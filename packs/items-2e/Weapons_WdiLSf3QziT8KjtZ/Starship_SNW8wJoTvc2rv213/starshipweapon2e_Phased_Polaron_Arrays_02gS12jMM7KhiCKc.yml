  description: >-
    <p>Favored by the Dominion, phased polaron weapons are highly effective
    at<br>cutting through deflector shields and other starship defenses.</p>

    <p>Long linked strips of emitters allow the weapon to discharge at any point
    along the strip, and often at multiple points along the strip if needed.
    This versatility allows a vessel to fire at multiple targets, or maintain
    fire on a moving target, from any direction.</p>
