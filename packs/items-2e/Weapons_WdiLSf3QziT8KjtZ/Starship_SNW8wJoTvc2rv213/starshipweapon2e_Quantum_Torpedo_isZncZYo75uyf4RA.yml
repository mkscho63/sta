  description: >-
    <p>A more advanced torpedo developed by the Federation in the wake of their
    clashes with the Borg, these destructive weapons add quantum vacuum energy
    to the energy released from their matter/antimatter reaction, giving them
    destructive power greater than the payload alone would normally produce.</p>
