    <p>Common to Starfleet and a few civilizations&rsquo; fleets, phasers are a
    precise and adaptable weapon.</p>

    <p>Long linked strips of emitters allow the weapon to discharge at any point
    along the strip, and often at multiple points along the strip if needed.
    This versatility allows a vessel to fire at multiple targets, or maintain
    fire on a moving target, from any direction.</p>
