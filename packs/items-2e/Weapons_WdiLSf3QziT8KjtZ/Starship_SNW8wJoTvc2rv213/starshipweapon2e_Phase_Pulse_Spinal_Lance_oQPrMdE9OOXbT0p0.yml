    <p>The predecessor to phasers, phase weapons were used by the United
    Earth&nbsp;Starfleet, and the Federation Starfleet that succeeded it, in the
    22nd century, but had largely been replaced by phasers in the 23rd
    century.</p>

    <p>Some ships integrate large weapon systems into their hulls, often running
    the length of the ship. These weapons are very powerful, but difficult to
    bring to bear against a target.</p>
