    <p>The predecessor to phasers, phase weapons were used by the United Earth
    Starfleet, and the Federation Starfleet that succeeded it, in the 22nd
    century, but had largely been replaced by phasers in the 23rd century.</p>

    <p>Long linked strips of emitters allow the weapon to discharge at any point
    along the strip, and often at multiple points along the strip if needed.
    This versatility allows a vessel to fire at multiple targets, or maintain
    fire on a moving target, from any direction.</p>
