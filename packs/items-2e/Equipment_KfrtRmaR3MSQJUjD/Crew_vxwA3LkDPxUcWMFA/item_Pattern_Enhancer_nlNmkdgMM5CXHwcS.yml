  description: >-
    <p>Used to boost the resolution and strength of a transporter scanning beam,
    pattern enhancers allow transporter systems to achieve a signal lock even
    with interference from terrain or cosmic phenomena. These devices are
    approximately a meter long when deployed on tripods and require at least
    three to function when placed equidistant around a target. Each
    device&rsquo;s power cell allows for two transports, and additional pattern
    enhancers can increase the area and number of transports.</p>
