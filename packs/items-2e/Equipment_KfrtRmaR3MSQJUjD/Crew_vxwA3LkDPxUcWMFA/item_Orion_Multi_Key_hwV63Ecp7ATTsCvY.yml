    <p>(NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE)</p>

    <p>A traditional tool of Orion merchants and pirates. Each&nbsp;one appears
    as a short cudgel (counts as a bludgeon in combat). Each tool can fold open,
    with extendable prongs serving a variety of functions, from overriding
    security systems, prying open panels, opening bottles, and even extracting
    teeth.</p>
