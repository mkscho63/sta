  description: >-
    <p>A standard part of Starfleet communicators since the&nbsp;late 23rd
    century. Characters not possessing a universal translator, either through
    destruction or removal of a communicator, will be unable to converse with
    beings who do not understand the character&rsquo;s languages. Obtaining a
    separate universal translator (Opportunity 1) provides a stand-alone unit,
    typically bulkier and more powerful than communicators.&nbsp;</p>
