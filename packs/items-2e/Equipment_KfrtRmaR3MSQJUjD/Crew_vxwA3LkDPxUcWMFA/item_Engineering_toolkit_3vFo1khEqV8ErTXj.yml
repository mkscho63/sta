    <p>(STANDARD ISSUE FOR ENGINEERS, OPPORTUNITY 1 OTHERWISE)</p>

    <p><br>The engineering multi-tool acted as a tricorder-like device to detect
    and diagnose system faults and could be used as a multi-purpose tool. With
    the advent of isolinear systems, the multi-tool was rendered obsolete and
    many of the device&rsquo;s uses were supplanted by the tricorder. Tools were
    still needed to maintain and repair damaged equipment, so the engineering
    toolkit was introduced to provide nearly every tool a damage control or
    engineering team may usually need.</p>
