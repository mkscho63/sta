  description: >-
    <p>These personal shields were sometimes issued to&nbsp;security and combat
    personnel, though the power requirements of such devices mean they have
    limited use in protracted fighting. A character with a personal forcefield
    gains the listed Protection, but it may also be sacrificed when you avoid an
    injury. When sacrificed, the type of injury is changed to a stun injury, and
    then the forcefield burns out and provides no further protection.</p>
