    <p>&ldquo;Tricorder&rdquo; is a catch-all label given to devices
    that&nbsp;sense, record, and analyze data.</p>

    <p><br>During the 23rd century, there were two versions of the Starfleet
    tricorder (science and medical), and a single highly-specialized version
    (the psychotricorder). The psychotricorder was primarily used by
    psychologists and law enforcement agencies to determine a humanoid&rsquo;s
    behavioral and emotional state more accurately.</p>

    <p><br>The more common medical and science tricorders differed in the range
    and scope of their sensors and ability to use attachments. The medical
    tricorder had fewer sensors and a shorter range as a tradeoff for
    higher-resolution scans oriented toward biological functions. The science
    tricorder had a large multi-discipline database and a built-in subspace
    uplink that could connect to nearby Starfleet vessels for main computer
    access when needed.</p>

    <p><br>By the 24th century, tricorders were unified into a single design as
    data storage and sensor design was further miniaturized, including more
    specialist analysis capabilities for engineering teams.</p>

    <p><br>Tricorders are standard issue, and do not have a cost.</p>
