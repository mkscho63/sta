    <p>The standard issue Starfleet beacon has a wide range of&nbsp;functions
    including changing the frequency of the light emitted from near-infrared to
    long-wave ultraviolet and providing a &lsquo;white&rsquo; light for species
    that evolved with different natural light. Beacons can also be set to emit
    entirely in the near-infrared, providing a short-term heat source in a
    survival situation.</p>
