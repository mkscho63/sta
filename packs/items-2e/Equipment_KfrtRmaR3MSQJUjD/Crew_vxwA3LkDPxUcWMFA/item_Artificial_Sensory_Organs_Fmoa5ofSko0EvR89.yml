  description: >-
    <p>Using neurological reconditioning and isolinear networks overlaid into a
    patient&rsquo;s sensory cortex, artificial sensory organs can replace
    damaged or destroyed senses. This can mean the blind can see, the deaf can
    hear, and even fingers can once again feel. Depending on what era the item
    was made, the technology can look highly artificial or barely
    noticeable.</p>

    <p>This technology includes sensors and other devices a&nbsp;person may find
    useful in their life. Work with the gamemaster to determine the device's
    functionality, look, and usefulness. While these devices can be
    advantageous, there are potential disadvantages too, such as charging the
    device periodically, headaches due to data transfer, or the risk of the
    device being lost or damaged.</p>
