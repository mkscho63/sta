  description: >-
    <p>Prosthetic limbs have been in use for centuries, and&nbsp;advances in
    technology mean they function identically to the limbs they replace. Arms,
    legs, and phalanges lost due to trauma can be replaced with little
    difficulty. Characters lacking their prosthetic may find their physical
    activities impaired, making some tasks more difficult and others
    impossible.</p>
