    receiver ties into shipboard communication networks and allows the user to
    listen to data coming across subspace frequencies typically used for
    long-range communication and ship to surface, but also listening to computer
    alerts and and data. The receiver can also be programmed to provide aural or
    vibrational feedback, allowing sensor operators greater accuracy in their
    duties. Characters using the audio receiver reduce the complication range of
    tasks involving communications, starship operations, or sensor operations by
