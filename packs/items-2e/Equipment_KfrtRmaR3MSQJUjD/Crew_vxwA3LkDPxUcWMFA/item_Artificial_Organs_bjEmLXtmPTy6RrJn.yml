    <p>Artificial organs have been in use since the mid-20th&nbsp;century.
    Advances in neuron meshing and cybernetics have improved these devices and
    made them virtually identical in capability to biological ones. Characters
    who need an artificial organ and do not possess them will die within minutes
    to days depending on the organ and are typically kept on life support while
    one is fabricated.</p>
