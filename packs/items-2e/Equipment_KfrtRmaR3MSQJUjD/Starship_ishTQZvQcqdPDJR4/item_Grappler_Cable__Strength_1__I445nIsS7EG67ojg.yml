  description: >-
    <p>The ship utilizes a physical cable with a magnetic hook at the end, in
    place of the graviton-based tractor beams used by ships in later eras. This
    functions as a tractor beam, but if the target breaks free, roll a d20: if
    you roll above the ship&rsquo;s Weapons system, the cable is damaged, and
    cannot be used until repaired. Repairing the cable is treated as repairing a
    breach.</p>

    <p>The Strength of the tractor beam is equal to the ship&rsquo;s Scale minus
    1. Trapping a target within the beam is a Difficulty 2 Control + Security
    task assisted by the ship&rsquo;s Structure + Security. If successful, the
    target is immobilized and cannot move until it can break free.</p>
