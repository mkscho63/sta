    <p>Vessels of this spaceframe lack deflector shields&nbsp;common to many
    other ships, and instead rely upon polarization of the hull plating to
    resist damage. The ship&rsquo;s Shields track instead represents the state
    of the ship&rsquo;s polarized hull. The ship&rsquo;s Shields are equal to
    its Structure, with no additional modifiers. However, these do not count as
    shields for the purposes of blocking transporter use.</p>
