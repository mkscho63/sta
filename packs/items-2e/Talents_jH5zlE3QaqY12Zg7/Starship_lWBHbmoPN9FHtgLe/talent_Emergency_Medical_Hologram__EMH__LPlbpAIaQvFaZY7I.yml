    <p>REQUIREMENT: 2371&ndash;2380</p>

    <p><br>The ship has one additional supporting character, an Emergency
    Medical Hologram (EMH), using the attributes, departments, and so forth as
    shown in the sidebar, which does not cost any Crew Support to introduce, and
    which does not automatically improve when introduced. This character can
    only go to locations on the ship which are equipped with holo-emitters.</p>

    <p><br>After 2380, this talent is obsolete, as all Starfleet vessels are
    outfitted with an EMH.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>SUBSEQUENT EMH MODELS<br>For every three years after 2371, the current
    model of EMH is replaced by a newer model (Mark II in 2374, Mark<br>III in
    2377, and Mark IV in 2380). After 2380, this talent is replaced by Advanced
    Emergency Crew Holograms.<br>Apply the following cumulative changes to these
    models:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>MARK II: +1 Presence</li>

    <li>MARK III: +1 Medicine</li>

    <li>MARK IV: Add the Technical Expertise talent (page 150)</li>

    </ul>
