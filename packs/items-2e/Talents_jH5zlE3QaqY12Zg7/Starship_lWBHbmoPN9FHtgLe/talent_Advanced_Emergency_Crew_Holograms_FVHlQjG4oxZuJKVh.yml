    <p>REQUIREMENT: 2380 onward</p>

    <p><br>The ship has several holographic supporting characters (which should
    be pregenerated, see page 146) equal to half the ship&rsquo;s Computers
    score (round up); their appearance and personality are determined when the
    ship is created, though the supporting characters have a species trait of
    Hologram. These can be activated or deactivated as a minor action, and they
    do not require any Crew Support to appear. They cannot operate outside of
    the ship, and they do not improve when introduced in subsequent adventures.
    However, if any character advances are used to improve these supporting
    characters, all the supporting characters granted by this talent receive the
    advance.</p>
