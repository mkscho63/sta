    <p>The ship gains the Advanced Medical Ward or Advanced Sickbay trait, which
    applies to all tasks related to medicine and biology performed within the
    ward or sickbay, and stacks with the normal benefits of being in sickbay
    (see page 190). This trait is lost if the ship&rsquo;s Computers system is
    disabled. In addition, the ship receives one additional Crew Support, which
    may only be used to introduce supporting characters from the Medical
    department.</p>
