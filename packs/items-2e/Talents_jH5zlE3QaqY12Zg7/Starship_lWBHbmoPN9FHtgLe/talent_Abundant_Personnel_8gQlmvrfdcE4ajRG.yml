    <p>The ship&rsquo;s Crew Support is doubled, after any other modifiers, and
    any effects or abilities which would increase Crew Support have twice the
    normal effect aboard a ship with this special rule. Further, when you
    introduce a supporting character, you may use one additional Crew Support to
    grant them an improvement immediately</p>
