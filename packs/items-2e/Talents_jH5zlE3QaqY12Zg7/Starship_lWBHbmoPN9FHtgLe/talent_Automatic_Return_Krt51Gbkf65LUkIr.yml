    <p><br>The ship&rsquo;s computer is programmed to recognize a starbase,
    colony, or some other location as its home base. The shuttles on board have
    the same programming and recognize the ship as their home base. If the
    ship&rsquo;s Computers system goes for 10 days without commands from the
    crew, it will automatically pilot the ship back to the home base at maximum
    impulse.</p>
