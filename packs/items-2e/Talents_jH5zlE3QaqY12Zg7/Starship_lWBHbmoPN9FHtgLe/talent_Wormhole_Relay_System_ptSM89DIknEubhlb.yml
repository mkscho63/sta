    <p>REQUIREMENT: 2371 or later</p>

    <p><br>The ship has an additional sensor system outfitted with high-energy
    transceivers, verteron sensors, and neutrino sensors. These sensors,
    combined with field-generation devices, allow the ship to send and receive
    data streams through wormholes. The Difficulty of all Science tasks to send
    or receive data through a wormhole is reduced by 2, to a minimum of 0.</p>
