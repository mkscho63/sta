    <p>When a character uses the Launch Probe minor action,&nbsp;the probe may
    be launched to a location up to five zones away. In addition, the probes are
    no longer destroyed if they take any damage; instead, each probe has 3
    Shield points, and are destroyed if they take one breach.</p>
