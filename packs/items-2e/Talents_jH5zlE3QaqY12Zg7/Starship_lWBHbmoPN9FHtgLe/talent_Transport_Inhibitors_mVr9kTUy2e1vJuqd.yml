    <p>While transporter inhibitors are active on the ship,&nbsp;nobody may
    transport onto or off the ship: all tasks to transport people or materials
    to or from the ship immediately fail. This necessarily means that the
    ship&rsquo;s own transporters are shut down, as they will not function
    alongside the inhibitors.</p>
