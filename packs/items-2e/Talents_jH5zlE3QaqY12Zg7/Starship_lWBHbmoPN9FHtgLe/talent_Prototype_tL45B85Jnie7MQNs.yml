    <p>The ship is brand new, first of her class, and laden with&nbsp;the newest
    technologies, assembled to be tested and studied. There are potentially a
    whole host of unknown problems and challenges to face, as novel systems
    clash or malfunction as they interact in unexpected ways.</p>

    <p><br>EXPERIMENTAL VESSEL: When the ship is created, apply two additional
    refits to the ship. In addition, whenever the ship assists a task attempt,
    the ship&rsquo;s die increases its complication range by 2 (to 18&ndash;20).
    A milestone refit (see page 167) can remove this complication range
    increase, representing the ship&rsquo;s crew working out the problems in the
    prototype design.</p>
