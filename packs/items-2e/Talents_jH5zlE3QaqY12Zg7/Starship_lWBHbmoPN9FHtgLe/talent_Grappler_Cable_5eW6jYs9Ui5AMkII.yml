  description: >-
    <p>The ship utilizes a physical cable with a magnetic hook&nbsp;at the end,
    in place of the graviton-based tractor beams used by ships in later eras.
    This functions as a tractor beam, but if the target breaks free, roll a d20:
    if you roll above the ship&rsquo;s Weapons system, the cable is damaged, and
    cannot be used until repaired. Repairing the cable is treated as repairing a
    breach.</p>
