    <p>REQUIREMENT: Klingon or Romulan ship, or gamemaster&rsquo;s
    discretion</p>

    <p><br>Activating the device is a major action which requires Reserve Power,
    and which requires a Control +&nbsp;Engineering task with a Difficulty of 2,
    assisted by the ship&rsquo;s Engines + Security. This is operated from the
    ship&rsquo;s Tactical position. If successful, the vessel gains the Cloaked
    trait. While cloaked, the vessel cannot attempt any attacks, nor can it be
    the target of an attack unless the attacker has found some way of detecting
    the cloaked vessel. While cloaked, a vessel&rsquo;s shields are down.
    Deactivating the cloaking device requires a minor action.</p>
