    <p>The ship&rsquo;s mess hall is equipped with top-of-the-line food
    preparation systems as well as vast stores of non-replicated food.</p>

    <p><br>Once per adventure, you may create a Fine Dining trait for free when
    the ship is visited by a VIP, diplomat, or other important guest. When a
    character attempts a task using Presence and/or Command and benefits from
    this trait, the character receives 1 bonus Momentum, which may not be
    saved.</p>
