    <p>The vessel&rsquo;s torpedo launchers have been designed&nbsp;to allow the
    ship to fire multiple torpedoes much more quickly and accurately. When the
    ship fires a torpedo salvo (page 229), the character at Tactical may re-roll
    a d20 on the Attack. Also, the weapon&rsquo;s Damage rating is increased by
    1.</p>
