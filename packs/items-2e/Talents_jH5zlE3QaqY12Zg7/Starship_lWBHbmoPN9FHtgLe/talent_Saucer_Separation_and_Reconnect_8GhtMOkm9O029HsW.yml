  description: >-
    <p>The ship is designed so the saucer section can be separated from the
    engineering section to operate as two distinct ships. Each section has the
    same systems, talents, and weapons, but their Scale is 1 lower than that of
    the original vessel (recalculate anything derived from Scale). Further, if
    the ship suffered any breaches prior to separating, ongoing effects of those
    breaches apply equally to both sections. The saucer section, which usually
    contains the crew quarters and recreation areas, does not have the capacity
    to go to warp. The secondary hull is commanded from main
    engineering.<br>Separating is a major action attempted from the bridge
    (Operations panel) or main engineering, requiring a Control + Conn task with
    a Difficulty of 3, assisted by the ship&rsquo;s Structure + Engineering.
    Reconnecting takes a major action, but the process is automated and requires
    no task attempt. Separating and reconnecting cannot be completed if the ship
    (or either part of it) has suffered one or more breaches to Structure.</p>
