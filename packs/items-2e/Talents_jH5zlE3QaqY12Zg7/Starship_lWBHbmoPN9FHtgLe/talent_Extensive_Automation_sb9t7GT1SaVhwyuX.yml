    <p>The ship has been configured to operate on a much smaller crew, relying
    on automation to handle tasks normally performed by personnel. Even purely
    physical tasks can be replaced by automation, using compact technical
    drones, such as the DOT-7 present on some 23rd century Starfleet vessels,
    like the U.S.S. Discovery.</p>

    <p><br>The ship&rsquo;s Crew Support is reduced to half its normal value
    (rounded up). However, the ship may attempt tasks by itself, and may even
    take a turn during a combat round by itself. If it does so, add 1 Threat
    before a task is attempted, and make the roll using the ship&rsquo;s systems
    and departments.</p>
