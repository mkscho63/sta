    <p>The vessel is equipped to land safely on a planetary&nbsp;surface, and
    can return to space afterward. To land a ship requires Reserve Power be
    rerouted to Structure, and then requires someone at the helm to attempt a
    Control + Conn task with a Difficulty equal to the ship&rsquo;s Scale,
    assisted by the ship&rsquo;s Structure + Conn. This can Succeed at Cost.
    Success means the ship lands on the planet&rsquo;s surface. Taking off
    requires the same task attempt, but the Difficulty is reduced by 2.</p>
