    <p>A ship with a variable geometry warp field can adjust its&nbsp;subspace
    field in highly turbulent spacetime and can continue to provide propulsive
    force even then. When you attempt a task to go to warp, you may select one
    trait in play which negatively affects the task roll, and ignore its
    effects.</p>
