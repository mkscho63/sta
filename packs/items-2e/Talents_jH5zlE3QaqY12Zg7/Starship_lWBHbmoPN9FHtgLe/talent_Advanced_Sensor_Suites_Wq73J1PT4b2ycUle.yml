    <p>Whenever a character performs a task roll assisted by&nbsp;the
    ship&rsquo;s Sensors, the ship may roll 2d20 for assistance rather than only
    one (if Reserve Power is rerouted to Sensors, one of these dice is set to a
    1). This talent cannot be used if the ship is suffering one or more breaches
    to Sensors.</p>
