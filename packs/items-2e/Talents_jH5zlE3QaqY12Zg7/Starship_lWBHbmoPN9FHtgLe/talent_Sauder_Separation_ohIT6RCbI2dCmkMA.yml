    <p>Vessels of this class have the capability to detach their&nbsp;saucer
    section in an emergency. Once the saucer has detached, the two sections of
    the ship cannot be reconnected outside of a drydock. Ship&rsquo;s systems
    are halved (round up) for the saucer and the secondary hull when separated,
    the saucer is unable to enter warp speeds or launch small craft, and each
    section is considered a separate vessel with Scale 1 less than the original
    vessel; the secondary hull is commanded from main engineering. The saucer
    can land on a planetary surface with emergency landing gear.</p>
