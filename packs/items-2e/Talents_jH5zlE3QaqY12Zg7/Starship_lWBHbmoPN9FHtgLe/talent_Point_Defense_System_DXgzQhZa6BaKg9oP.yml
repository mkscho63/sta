    <p>The ship is equipped with a system of small energy&nbsp;weapon emitters
    that operates independently from the main weapons systems. When a torpedo
    targets the ship, these emitters start firing in the direction the torpedo
    is traveling from, potentially destroying it before it impacts the shields
    or the ship&rsquo;s hull.</p>

    <p><br>This system does not function while the ship is travelling at warp.
    The ship is considered to have Cover against torpedo attacks, increasing the
    Difficulty of the attack by 1. This talent stops functioning if the ship has
    suffered one or more breaches to the Weapons system.</p>
