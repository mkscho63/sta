    <p>You joined the Initiate Program, hoping to be chosen by the Symbiosis
    Commission to become Joined. As there are far more Initiates than there are
    symbionts, you were one of many who failed, but the capabilities of even a
    failed Initiate are highly sought after by Starfleet and other
    organizations. When you attempt a task using Control or Reason, and you
    spend Determination to set a die as a 1, you may also re-roll your dice pool
    after the roll. You cannot select this&nbsp;talent if you have the Joined
    talent.</p>
