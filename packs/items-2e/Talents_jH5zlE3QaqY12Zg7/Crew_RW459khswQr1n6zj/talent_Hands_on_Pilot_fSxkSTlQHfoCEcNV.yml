    <p>REQUIREMENTS: Conn 3+ and Engineering 3+</p>

    <p><br>When you perform the Warp, Evasive Action, or Attack Pattern major
    actions, the ship may count its focus range as double the relevant
    department rating (i.e., if the ship has a Conn of 3, it will score a
    critical success on any roll of 6 or less). However, when anyone else pilots
    the ship, increase the complication range by 1.</p>
