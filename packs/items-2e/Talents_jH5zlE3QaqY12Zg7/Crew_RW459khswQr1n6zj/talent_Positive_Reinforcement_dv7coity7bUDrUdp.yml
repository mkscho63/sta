    <p>REQUIREMENTS: Ship&rsquo;s Counselor role, Medicine 3+, and Presence
    9+</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Once per mission, you may attempt a Presence +&nbsp;Medicine task with a
    Difficulty of 3, while providing emotional or mental treatment for another
    character. Success creates a character trait for your patient that lasts
    until the end of the mission: Boosted Confidence. In addition to the normal
    effects of the trait, that character can reroll their dice pool, as if
    they&rsquo;d spent Determination, once before the end of the mission. If the
    task the character used their reroll on fails, they lose the trait created
    by this talent.</p>
