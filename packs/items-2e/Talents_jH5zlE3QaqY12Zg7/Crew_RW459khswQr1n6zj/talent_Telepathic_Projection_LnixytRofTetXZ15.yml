    <p>REQUIREMENT: Telepathy</p>

    <p><br>Your telepathic ability is more potent than most, and you are
    accustomed to projecting your thoughts into other minds. You can send your
    thoughts into the minds of other creatures&mdash;other than those immune to
    telepathy&mdash;even if those creatures are not telepathic themselves. You
    can &lsquo;hear&rsquo; their responses by reading their minds. You are also
    capable of using this ability offensively, overwhelming a target&rsquo;s
    mind with pain-inducing psychic noise. This requires a Presence + Security
    task with a Difficulty of 2 (increasing by 1 for each range category beyond
    Close); success inflicts a Stun or Deadly Injury with Severity 3 and the
    Piercing effect.</p>
