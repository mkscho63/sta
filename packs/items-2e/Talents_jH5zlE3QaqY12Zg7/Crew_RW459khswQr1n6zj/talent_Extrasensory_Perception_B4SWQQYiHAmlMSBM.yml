    <p>You have an ability to perceive things beyond the normal limits of
    humanoid senses, allowing you to gain knowledge of people, places, and
    objects beyond your ability to sense them conventionally. This is known as
    extra-sensory perception, or ESP. It is not directly under your control but
    instead tends to come in the form of accurate guesses, strong feelings, or
    flashes of insight. Such sensitivity often leaves you vulnerable to psychic
    dangers as&nbsp;well. At any point during play, you may ask the gamemaster
    for hints or insights about the current situation, and the gamemaster may
    similarly offer you information about the current situation that you would
    not normally be able to determine. Each hint adds 1 Threat, and you may
    always refuse to accept the hints offered.</p>
