    <p>You care for the crew of your ship, or the station you serve on (in which
    case, rename the role to Station&rsquo;s Doctor), but unlike a chief medical
    officer, you do not have an extensive medical department to manage or to aid
    you. This is common in smaller crews which do not require a large sickbay or
    infirmary and tends to mean these smaller postings favor generalists who can
    adapt to a variety of circumstances.</p>

    <p>A ship may have either a chief medical officer or a ship&rsquo;s
    doctor.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>ROLE BENEFIT: You have two additional focuses, which must relate to
    medicine fields of study. However, your ship cannot use Crew Support to
    introduce supporting characters who are medical personnel.</p>
