    <p>You are bonded with a symbiont and have lifetimes of memories to draw
    upon. You gain an additional character trait, which is the name of the
    symbiont; this reflects potential advantages of being Joined, as well as the
    ability to perform rites and rituals to awaken past hosts&rsquo; memories,
    and the vulnerabilities inherent in the connection. Furthermore, up to twice
    per adventure, you may declare that a past Host had experience or expertise
    in a particular field: you gain an additional focus when you do this, which
    remains for the rest of the adventure.</p>
