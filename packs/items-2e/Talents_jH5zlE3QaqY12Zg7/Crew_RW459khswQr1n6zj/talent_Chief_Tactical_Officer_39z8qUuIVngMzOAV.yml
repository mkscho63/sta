    <p>A presence on 22nd and 23rd century Starfleet ships, and common in other
    organizations, this role is also known as an armory officer or weapons
    officer. The officer is responsible for the upkeep and use of the
    ship&rsquo;s armaments and is typically an expert in ship-to-ship
    combat.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>ROLE BENEFIT: When you succeed at an Attack with the ship&rsquo;s
    weapons, you may increase the damage rating of that weapon system by
    spending 1 Momentum rather than 2.</p>
