    <p>When you succeed at any task using your Command during an action scene,
    you may spend Momentum to recover Stress suffered by your allies. When you
    spend 1&nbsp;Momentum (Repeatable), one ally who can see and hear you
    recovers 1 Stress. You may affect multiple allies, but each ally affected
    may only recover 1 Stress in this way each time this talent is used.</p>
