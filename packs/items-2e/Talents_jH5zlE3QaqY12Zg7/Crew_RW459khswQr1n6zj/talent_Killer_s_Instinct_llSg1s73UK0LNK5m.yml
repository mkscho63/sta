    <p>So familiar are you with the intent to kill that you can even see it in
    others when you look them in the eyes. When you make a Deadly Attack, reduce
    the amount you add to Threat to 0. In addition, when an enemy attempts to
    make a Deadly Attack against you, you may add 1 Threat to increase the
    Difficulty of their Attack by 1, as&nbsp;you react to their intent.</p>
