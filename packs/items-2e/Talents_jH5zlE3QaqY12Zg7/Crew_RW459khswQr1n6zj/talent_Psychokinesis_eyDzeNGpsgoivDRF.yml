    <p>You can manipulate and control objects using only the power of the mind.
    You may exert a psychic force upon an object within Close range equivalent
    to the force that you would normally be able to exert physically, though
    this takes concentration and cannot be done violently. You may spend 1
    Momentum (Immediate, Repeatable) to increase the magnitude of the force you
    apply, with each Momentum spent counting as an additional person&rsquo;s
    worth of force applied (that is, you can move or manipulate objects that
    would take two people to move or manipulate by spending 1 Momentum).
    Momentum (Immediate) may also be spent to increase the range of this: 1
    Momentum to affect objects in Medium range, 2 Momentum to affect objects at
    Long range, and gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion for distances beyond. To apply
    force violently instead, add 1 Threat to make a Control + Security task with
    a Difficulty of 2 to strike an opponent (as a Ranged Attack), inflicting a
    Stun or Deadly Injury&nbsp;with a Severity of 3.</p>
