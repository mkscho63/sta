    <p>You are capable of emitting pheromones which can render Orion males (and
    others) suggestible. These pheromones affect several other
    species&mdash;including Humans&mdash;in a similar way. When dealing with
    males of a species affected by these pheromones, you gain 2 bonus Momentum
    on all tasks to persuade or command them. However, female members of species
    affected often suffer headaches because of the pheromones, increasing the
    complication range of tasks to interact with them by 1. Vulcans are known to
    be unaffected, while Denobulans experience a different effect and become
    drowsy. The gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion applies as to which species are
    affected, which are immune, and which suffer unexpected effects, but most
    species are&nbsp;affected similarly to Humans and Orions.</p>
