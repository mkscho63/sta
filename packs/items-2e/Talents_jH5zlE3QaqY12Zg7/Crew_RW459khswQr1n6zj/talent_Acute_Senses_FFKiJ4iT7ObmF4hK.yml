    <p>The Aenar have honed their senses to the point that they are able to
    respond to stimuli just as well as, if not superior to, those who possess
    the ability to see. When&nbsp;attempting a task to detect something which is
    hidden from conventional senses, or which would normally be difficult to
    perceive, you may re-roll 1d20.</p>
