    <p>You have received a vision from the Bajoran Prophets, through one of the
    Orbs. This rare experience, though confusing at first, has shaped your life
    and outlook. You have one additional value, which represents some prophecy
    or insight into the future gained from your vision. Furthermore, once per
    session, when that value is used, you gain twice the normal benefit: if you
    spend Determination, you may gain two benefits listed, while if you would
    gain Determination, you gain 2 points&nbsp; instead of 1.</p>
