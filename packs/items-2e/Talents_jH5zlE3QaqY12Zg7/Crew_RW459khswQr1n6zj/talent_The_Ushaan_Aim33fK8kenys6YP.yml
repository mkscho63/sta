    <p>You are experienced in the tradition of honor-dueling known as the
    Ushaan. When you make a Melee Attack, or are targeted by a Melee Attack, and
    buy one or more d20s by adding to Threat, you may re-roll any number of dice
    in your dice pool for the task. Further, you own an Ushaan-tor, a
    razor-sharp ice-miner&rsquo;s tool used in these duels. The Ushaan-tor is a
    blade (see page 242), and it&nbsp;counts as standard issue for you.</p>
