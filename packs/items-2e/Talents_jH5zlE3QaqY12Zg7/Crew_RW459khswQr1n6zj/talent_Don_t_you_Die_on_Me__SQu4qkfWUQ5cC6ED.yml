  description: >-
    <p>When a character is killed, you may spend&nbsp;Determination to make one
    attempt to revive them. If they were killed instantly by an Attack, then
    this may only be attempted within that scene. If the character suffered an
    Injury and died because they didn&rsquo;t receive medical treatment in time,
    this may be attempted before the end of the subsequent scene. This requires
    a Daring + Medicine task, with a Difficulty of 3. If successful, the
    character is brought back from the brink of death, though they will remain
    Defeated for the remainder of the adventure. Failure means that your efforts
    were unsuccessful and the character dies.</p>
