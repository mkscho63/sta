    <p>REQUIREMENT: Cyborg trait</p>

    <p><br>You have a cybernetic device that replaces one of your
    senses&mdash;most commonly sight or hearing. You gain the Artificial Sense
    trait, which represents the ways that your senses differ from those of other
    members of your species. Further, when you attempt a task to locate
    something hidden or concealed, or to detect details not normally perceptible
    to that sense, you may re-roll a single d20.</p>
