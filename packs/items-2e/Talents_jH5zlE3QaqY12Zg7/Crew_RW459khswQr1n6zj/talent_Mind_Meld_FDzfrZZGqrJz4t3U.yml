    <p>You&rsquo;ve undergone training in telepathic techniques that allow the
    melding of minds through physical contact. This always requires a task
    (normally Control + Sciences) with a Difficulty of at least 1, which can be
    opposed by an unwilling participant. If successful, you link minds with the
    participant, sharing thoughts and memories. Momentum may be spent to gain
    more information or perform deeper telepathic exchanges. This link goes both
    ways, and it is a tiring and potentially hazardous process. Complications
    can result in taking Stress, pain, disorientation, or lingering emotional
    or&nbsp;behavioral difficulties.</p>
