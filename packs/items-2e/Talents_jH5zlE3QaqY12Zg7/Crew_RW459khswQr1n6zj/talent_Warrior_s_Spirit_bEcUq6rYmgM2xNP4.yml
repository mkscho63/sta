    <p>When you make a Melee Attack, or are targeted by a Melee Attack, and you
    buy one or more d20s by adding Threat, you may re-roll the dice pool for
    your task roll.&nbsp;Further, you own either a mek&rsquo;leth (a blade) or a
    bat&rsquo;leth (a heavy blade) at your discretion, which counts as standard
    issue for you.</p>
