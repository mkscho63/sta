    <p>You have a large family, with many children, nieces, and nephews, and
    you&rsquo;ve learned how to coordinate even the most unruly and fractious of
    groups when necessary. When attempting or assisting a task, and two or more
    other characters are involved in the task, the first complication generated
    on the task&mdash;either by the character attempting the task, or one of the
    assistants&mdash;may&nbsp;be ignored.</p>
