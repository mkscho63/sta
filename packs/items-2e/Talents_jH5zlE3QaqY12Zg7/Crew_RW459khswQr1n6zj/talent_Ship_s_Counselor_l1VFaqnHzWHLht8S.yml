    <p>On larger ships and starbases, it&rsquo;s common (especially in the 24th
    century and beyond) to have personnel dedicated to the mental well-being of
    the crew. Some captains regard them as valuable advisors, as their training
    covers both culture and psychology, making them exceptionally good at
    reading the moods and intentions of others.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>ROLE BENEFIT: When you Assist a character suffering from a trait
    representing a negative emotional state, you may re-roll your assist die.
    Additionally, once per mission, you may spend a scene counseling a character
    who has challenged one of their values during the current mission. At the
    end of the scene, the character may rewrite their crossed-out value
    immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the mission. If they do
    this, they immediately gain 1 Determination as well.</p>
