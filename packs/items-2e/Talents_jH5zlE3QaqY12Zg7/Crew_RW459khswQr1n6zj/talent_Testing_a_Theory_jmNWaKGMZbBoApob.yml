    <p>When you attempt a task using Engineering or Science,&nbsp;the first
    bonus d20 you purchase is free, so long as you succeeded at a previous task
    covering the same scientific or technological field earlier in the same
    adventure. If you created a trait that represents a hypothesis about an
    unknown phenomenon, you may also re-roll one d20 on tasks related to that
    hypothesis.</p>
