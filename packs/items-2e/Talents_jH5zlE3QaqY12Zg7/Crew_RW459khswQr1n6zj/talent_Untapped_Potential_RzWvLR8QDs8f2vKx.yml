    <p>REQUIREMENT: Novice (only available during character creation)</p>

    <p><br>Select one of your attributes when you receive this talent.
    You&rsquo;re inexperienced, but talented and with a bright future. You may
    not have or increase any attribute to above 11, or any department to above 4
    while you have this talent (and may have to adjust attributes and
    departments accordingly at the end of character creation). <br>Whenever you
    succeed at a task for which you bought one or more additional dice (by any
    means), roll a d20 after the roll. If you roll equal to or less than the
    chosen attribute, gain 1 bonus Momentum; if you roll higher, add 1 Threat
    instead. While you possess this talent, you cannot gain any higher rank than
    Lieutenant (junior grade),&nbsp; or a higher enlisted rate than Petty
    Officer.</p>
