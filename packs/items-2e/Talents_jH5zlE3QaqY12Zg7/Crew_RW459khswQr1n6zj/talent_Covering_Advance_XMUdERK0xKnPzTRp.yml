    <p>When you succeed at a task to maneuver your ship, you may spend 2
    Momentum to provide cover for allied ships. When an enemy vessel next makes
    an Attack, before the beginning of your next turn, if you are the closest
    ship to that attacker but they do not target you,&nbsp;the difficulty of
    their Attack is equal to your ship&rsquo;s Scale.</p>
