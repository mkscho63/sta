    <p>The Orions are known as one of the most untrustworthy species in the
    Galaxy, next to the Ferengi, and yet people are willing to do business with
    them or are often tricked&nbsp;or misled by them. You&rsquo;ve learned the
    subtle interplay of social interactions, reputations, and plausible denials
    that allow others to trust you despite what they&rsquo;ve heard about
    &lsquo;those other Orions&rsquo;. When another character attempts a task to
    determine if they can trust you, you may spend 2 Momentum if you are
    sincere, or add 2 Threat if you&rsquo;re attempting to deceive them. Either
    way, the character does not need to make a task roll: you convince them you
    are trustworthy.</p>
