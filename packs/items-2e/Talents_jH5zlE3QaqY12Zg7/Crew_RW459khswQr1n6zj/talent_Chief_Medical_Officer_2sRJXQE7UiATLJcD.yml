    <p>The chief medical officer is responsible for the health and well-being of
    the crew and other people aboard the ship and leads the ship&rsquo;s medical
    department. A chief medical officer can order, and countermand the orders
    of, senior officers where matters of that officer&rsquo;s health are
    concerned. In extreme situations, the chief medical officer can declare an
    officer unfit and remove them from active duty (including the commanding
    officer). A ship may have either a chief medical officer or a ship&rsquo;s
    doctor.</p>
