    <p>Whenever you succeed at a Conn task to identify a type of starship, or to
    try to understand an unknown form of starship, you gain 1 bonus Momentum,
    which may only be used on the Obtain Information Momentum spend, or to pay
    part of the cost of the Create Trait Momentum spend (where the trait must
    represent some form of&nbsp;known or observed weakness in the ship being
    studied).</p>
