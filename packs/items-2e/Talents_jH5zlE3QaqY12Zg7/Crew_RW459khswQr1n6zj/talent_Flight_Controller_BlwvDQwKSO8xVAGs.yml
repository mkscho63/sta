    <p>Also known as a helmsman on 22nd and 23rd century Starfleet vessels. Not
    a typical senior staff role, though some captains, particularly those
    operating in uncharted space, choose the most senior helmsman or flight
    control officer to serve on the senior staff.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>ROLE BENEFIT: When you attempt an engineering task related to flight or
    propulsion, you may use your Conn rating instead of Engineering. When you
    succeed at a Conn task to pilot a starship, you generate 1 bonus Momentum to
    be used on that task (bonus Momentum may not be saved).</p>
