    <p>The operations manager manages and oversees all technical operations
    aboard or involving the ship, normally from the operations station on the
    bridge, or in conjunction with the chief engineer (on smaller ships, one
    officer may fill both roles). This often entails taking on the duties of a
    science officer if there is no dedicated science officer among the senior
    staff.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>ROLE BENEFIT: Whenever you create a trait representing a piece of
    equipment, or an alteration made to existing equipment, any character who
    benefits from that trait while you are present in the scene may re-roll a
    d20.</p>
