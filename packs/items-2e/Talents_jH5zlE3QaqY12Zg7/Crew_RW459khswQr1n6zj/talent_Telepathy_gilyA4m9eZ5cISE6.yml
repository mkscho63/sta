    <p>You can sense the surface thoughts and emotions of most living beings
    nearby, and can communicate telepathically with other empaths and telepaths,
    as well as those with whom you are extremely familiar. You cannot choose not
    to sense the emotions or read the surface thoughts of those nearby, except
    for those resistant to telepathy. It requires effort and a task to pick out
    the emotions or thoughts of a specific individual in a crowd, to search a
    creature&rsquo;s mind for specific thoughts or memories, or to block out the
    minds of those nearby. Increase the Difficulty if the situation is
    stressful, if there are many beings present, if the target target is
    resistant&nbsp;to telepathy, etc.</p>
