    <p>REQUIREMENT: Veteran (during character creation, or at gamemaster&rsquo;s
    discretion)</p>

    <p><br>You&rsquo;re wise and experienced, and draw upon inner reserves of
    willpower and determination in a measured and considered way. Whenever you
    spend Determination, roll a d20. If you roll equal to or less than your
    Control rating, you immediately regain that point of Determination. If you
    are Starfleet or military, you hold a rank of at least lieutenant commander,
    or an enlisted rate of at least chief petty officer.</p>
