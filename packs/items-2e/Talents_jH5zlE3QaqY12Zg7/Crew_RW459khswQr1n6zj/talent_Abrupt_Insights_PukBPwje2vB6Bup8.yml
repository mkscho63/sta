    <p>Your insight into the minds of others can give you an edge when
    interacting with them, though not everyone is comfortable having someone
    else speak their mind. When you attempt a task as part of a social conflict,
    you can increase the complication range by 1, 2, or 3; if you succeed, you
    generate bonus Momentum equal to the complication range increase. Bonus
    Momentum may&nbsp;not be saved.</p>
