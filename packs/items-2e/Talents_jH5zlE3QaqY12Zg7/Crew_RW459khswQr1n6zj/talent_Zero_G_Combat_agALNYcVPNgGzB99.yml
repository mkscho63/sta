    <p>REQUIREMENTS: Conn 3+ and Security 3+</p>

    <p><br>In combat, when you make an Attack while in a zero-gravity or
    micro-gravity environment, you may use the higher of your Conn or Security
    departments for the task, and you ignore any difficulty increases caused by
    the lack of gravity. In addition, enemies who lack similar training increase
    the Difficulty of Attacks against you by 1.</p>
