    <p>Whenever you attempt an Engineering task to perform repairs, you may
    reduce the Difficulty by 2, to a minimum of 0. If you do this, however, then
    the repairs are only temporary and will last only a single scene before they
    fail again; you may increase this duration&nbsp;by one scene by spending 1
    Momentum (Repeatable). Jury-rigged repairs can only be applied once, and the
    Difficulty to repair a device that has been Jury-rigged increases by 1.</p>
