    <p>REQUIREMENT: Cyborg trait</p>

    <p><br>You have a cybernetic device implanted directly into your brain,
    allowing you to interface with computers and similar technologies with their
    thoughts. Initiating or breaking the link between your mind and a computer
    system takes a minor action, and while you are connected, you may reroll one
    d20 on any task using that computer (including a ship&rsquo;s Computer
    system). However, if the computer (or the ship containing it) is damaged,
    you immediately suffer a Deadly 4 Injury with the Piercing quality.</p>
