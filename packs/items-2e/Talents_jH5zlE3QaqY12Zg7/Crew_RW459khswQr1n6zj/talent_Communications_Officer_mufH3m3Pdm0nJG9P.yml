    <p>More common in the earlier days of Starfleet, dedicated communications
    officers are typically skilled in linguistics and cryptography, and aided
    with advanced translation and decryption technologies, and are valuable
    during encounters with new cultures, hostile or otherwise.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>ROLE BENEFIT: When you attempt a task assisted by the ship&rsquo;s
    Computers or Communications systems, do not roll the ship&rsquo;s assist
    die: instead, count the ship&rsquo;s die as if it had rolled a 1.</p>
