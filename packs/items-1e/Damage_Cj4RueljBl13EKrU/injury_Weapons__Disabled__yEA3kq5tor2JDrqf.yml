    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Weapons System has suffered is equal
    to the Scale of the ship, then the System has been Disabled. The Weapons
    System cannot be used to perform or assist any Tasks (even those that would
    normally be Difficulty 0), which means the ship cannot make Attacks. The
    Difficulty to repair this is 4, though at the Gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion
    this may be replaced with an Extended Task (Work 8, Magnitude 2, Resistance
    1, base Difficulty 2).</p>
