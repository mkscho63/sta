    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Communications system has suffered
    exceeds the ship&rsquo;s Scale, then the system has been Destroyed and must
    be replaced. This is identical to the disabled effect, but it cannot be
    repaired. Further hits on the Communications system damage the Computers
    system instead.</p>
