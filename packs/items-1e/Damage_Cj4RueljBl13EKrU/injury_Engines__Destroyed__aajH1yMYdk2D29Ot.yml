    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Engines system has suffered exceeds
    the ship&rsquo;s Scale, then the system has been destroyed, and cannot be
    repaired. The ship cannot move or maneuver, it loses 3 Power at the end of
    every Round, and it has a normal Power capacity of 0 (meaning it will begin
    the subsequent scenes with 0 Power). Further, roll a number of Challenge
    Dice equal to the number of Breaches that Engines have suffered beyond the
    ship&rsquo;s Scale (so, if the ship&rsquo;s Scale is 4, and it has suffered
    6 Breaches to Engines, roll 2 Challenge Dice). If any Effects are rolled,
    the ship&rsquo;s warp engines lose containment, and may explode, as
    described in the &ldquo;Warp Core Breach Imminent!&rdquo; sidebar.
    Subsequent Breaches caused to Engines trigger another roll to see if the
    reactors lose containment.</p>

    <h1>Warp Core Breach Imminent!</h1>

    <p>Catastrophic damage to the engines is a serious matter, increasing the
    risk of losing containment over the volatile reactors that power the ship.
    The ships of many cultures, including the Federation, rely on powerful
    matter/antimatter reactions, which can cause catastrophic explosions if
    uncontrolled, while the Romulans use a similarly-dangerous artificial
    singularity to power their warp engines.</p>

    <p>If the ship suffers a loss of containment, then the reactors may explode
    at any moment; roll one or more Challenge Dice at the end of each Round,
    starting with 1 Challenge Die at the end of the Round in which the
    containment loss began, and increasing by +1 Challenge Die for each
    successive Round (so, 2 Challenge Dice for the second round, 3 Challenge
    Dice for the third, and so forth). If one or more Effects are rolled, the
    reactors explode, destroying the ship immediately, killing all aboard, and
    inflicting 3 Piercing 2 damage to all other ships within Close range. Add a
    number of additional to this damage equal to the exploding ship&rsquo;s
    Scale (bigger ships have bigger reactors).</p>

    <p>This can, however, be avoided. Characters in engineering may attempt to
    stabilize the reactor, or they may try to eject the reactor entirely (though
    not all ships have the capability to eject their reactors, so their crews
    may wish to abandon ship).</p>

    <p><strong>Stabilize the reactor:</strong> This is an Extended Task, with
    Work 8, Magnitude 3, Resistance 2, and a Base Difficulty of 3. Succeeding at
    this Extended Task prevents the reactor from exploding. Common combinations
    for this will be <strong>Daring or Control</strong>, plus
    <strong>Engineering</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Eject the reactor:</strong> This is a <strong>Daring +
    Engineering Task</strong>, with a Difficulty of 2. Success means that the
    reactor is successfully ejected. If ejected, continue to roll to see if it
    explodes; when it does, it will not destroy the ship (as it&rsquo;s been
    ejected and is no longer within the ship), but all ships, including the one
    that ejected it, within Close range will still suffer damage when it
    detonates.</p>
