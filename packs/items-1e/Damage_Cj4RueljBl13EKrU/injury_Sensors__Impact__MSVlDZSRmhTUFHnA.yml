    <p>Whenever the Sensors system suffers one or more Breaches, it disrupts
    those functions temporarily. Until the sensor operations officer performs
    the <em>Restore </em>Minor Action, no Task can be attempted which will use
    or be assisted by the ship&rsquo;s Sensors. Further, until that Minor Action
    is performed, all Attacks made by the ship increase in Difficulty by 1.</p>
