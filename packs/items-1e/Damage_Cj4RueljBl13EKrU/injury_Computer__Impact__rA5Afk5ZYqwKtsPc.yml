    <p>Whenever the Computers system suffers one or more Breaches, it disrupts
    those functions temporarily. Until the officer at the internal systems
    position (or someone in Engineering) performs the <em>Restore </em>Minor
    Action, the Computers system cannot be used to perform or assist any Tasks;
    additionally, all other Tasks attempted which are assisted by the ship
    increase their Complication range by 2, until that <em>Restore </em>Minor
    Action has been performed, due to disruptions in automation.</p>
