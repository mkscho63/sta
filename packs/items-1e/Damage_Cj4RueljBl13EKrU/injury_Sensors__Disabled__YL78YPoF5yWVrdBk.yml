    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Sensors System has suffered is equal
    to the Scale of the ship, then the system has been Disabled. The Sensors
    System cannot be used to perform or assist any Tasks (even those that would
    normally be Difficulty 0), and attacks made by the ship increase in
    Difficulty by +2. The Difficulty to repair this is 4, though at the
    Gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion this may be replaced with an Extended Task
    (Work 10, Magnitude 2, Resistance 1, base Difficulty 2).</p>
