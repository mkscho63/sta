  description: >-
    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Structure System has suffered is
    equal to or greater than half the Scale of the ship, then the System has
    been significantly Damaged. The vessel suffers fires and/or minor hull
    breaches somewhere on the ship, forcing the area to be evacuated and sealed
    off. This makes it more problematic to reach parts of the ship in need of
    repair, increasing the Complication Range of all Engineering Tasks to repair
    Systems by 2. This also reduces the ship&rsquo;s Resistance by 1. The
    Difficulty to repair this is 3.</p>
