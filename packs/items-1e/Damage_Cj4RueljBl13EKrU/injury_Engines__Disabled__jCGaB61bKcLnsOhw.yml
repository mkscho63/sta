    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Engines system has suffered is equal
    to the Scale of the ship, then the system has been Disabled. The Engines
    System cannot be used to perform or assist any Tasks (even those that would
    normally be Difficulty 0), loss of power generation means that the ship
    loses 2 Power at the end of every Round. The Difficulty to repair this is 5,
    though at the Gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion this may be replaced with an
    Extended Task (Work 10, Magnitude 3, Resistance 2, base Difficulty 2).</p>
