  description: >-
    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Structure System has suffered exceeds
    the ship&rsquo;s Scale, then the ship&rsquo;s hull integrity has been
    massively compromised, requiring nothing less than a full rebuild in
    Spacedock. With hull breaches across the ship, fires raging, and life
    support systems failing, the ship is crippled. The ship&rsquo;s Resistance
    is 0, Tasks to repair other systems on the ship can no longer be attempted
    during combat, and the ship may not move except by thrusters, as rapid
    movement might tear the ship apart. Subsequent hits to Structure affect the
    Engines System instead.</p>
