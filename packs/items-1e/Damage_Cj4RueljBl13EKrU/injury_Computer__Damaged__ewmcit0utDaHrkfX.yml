    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Computers System has suffered is
    equal to or greater than half the Scale of the ship, then the System has
    been significantly Damaged. This increases the Difficulty of all Tasks that
    involve or are assisted by the ship&rsquo;s Computers by +2, and increases
    the Complication range of all other Tasks assisted by the ship by 1, until
    repaired. The Difficulty to repair this is 3.</p>
