    <p>Whenever the Communications system suffers one or more Breaches, it
    disrupts those functions temporarily. Until the communications officer
    performs the <em>Restore </em>Minor Action, the Communications System cannot
    be used to perform or assist any Tasks; additionally, any ongoing or
    persistent activities that require Communications Systems &mdash; such as
    transferring information over multiple rounds &mdash; are immediately
    halted, and cannot be resumed until that <em>Restore </em>Minor Action has
    been performed.</p>
