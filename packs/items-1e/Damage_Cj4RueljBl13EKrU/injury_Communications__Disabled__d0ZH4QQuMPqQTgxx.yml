    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Communications System has suffered is
    equal to the Scale of the ship, then the system has been Disabled. The
    Communications system cannot be used to perform or assist any Tasks, and
    communicating over distances greater than a few kilometers (Close range),
    using other subspace radios, etc. The Difficulty to repair this is 4, though
    at the Gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion this may be replaced with an Extended
    Task (Work 8, Magnitude 2, Resistance 0, base Difficulty 2).</p>
