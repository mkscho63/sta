  description: >-
    <p>Whenever the Structure System suffers one or more Breaches, the entire
    ship shudders, power conduits rupture, consoles explode, and personnel are
    hurled around. Roll 1 Challenge Die; if an Effect is rolled, then a random
    character on the ship (Player Character or important NPC) has been Injured
    (the character may Avoid the Injury as normal, if they would normally be
    allowed to). These Injuries are considered to be Lethal. For NPC ships,
    suffering one or more Breaches to Structure means that the ship has one
    fewer Turn during the next Round (this is not cumulative).</p>
