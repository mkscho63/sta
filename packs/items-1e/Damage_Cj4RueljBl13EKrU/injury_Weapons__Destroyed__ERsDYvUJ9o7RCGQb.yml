  description: >-
    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Weapons system has suffered exceeds
    the ship&rsquo;s Scale, then the system has been Destroyed, and cannot be
    repaired. This is identical to the Disabled effect, but it cannot be
    repaired. Further, roll 1 Challenge Die if the ship fired any weapons during
    this Turn; if an Effect is rolled, then the ship suffers a single hit from
    the weapon used most recently, as energy weapons discharge unsafely or
    torpedoes detonate. Further hits to the Weapons System will affect the
    Sensors instead.</p>
