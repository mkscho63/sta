    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Sensors System has suffered exceeds
    the ship&rsquo;s Scale, then the System has been Destroyed, and cannot be
    repaired. This is identical to the Disabled effect, but it cannot be
    repaired. Further hits on the Sensors System damage the Weapons System
    instead.</p>
