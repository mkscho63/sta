  description: >-
    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Structure System has suffered is
    equal to the Scale of the ship, then the System has been disabled. The
    vessel has suffered many fires and serious hull breaches, as well as
    sections losing life support. The extreme disarray of the ship makes it
    extremely difficult to perform repairs, increasing the Complication range of
    all Engineering Tasks to repair the ship by 3, and the Difficulty of all
    Engineering Tasks to repair the ship by +1. This also reduces the
    ship&rsquo;s Resistance to half (rounding down) its normal value. The
    Difficulty to repair this &mdash; including the penalty from this damage
    &mdash; is 5, though at the Gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion this may be
    replaced with an Extended Task (Work 10, Magnitude 3, Resistance 2, base
    Difficulty 1).</p>
