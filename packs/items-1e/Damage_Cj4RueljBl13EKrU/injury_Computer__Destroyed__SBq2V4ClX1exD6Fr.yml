    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Computers system has suffered exceeds
    the ship&rsquo;s Scale, then the System has been Destroyed and must be
    replaced. This is identical to the Disabled effect, but it cannot be
    repaired. Further hits on the Computers system damage the Communications
    system instead.</p>
