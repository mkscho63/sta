    <p>If the total number of Breaches the Engines system has suffered is equal
    to or greater than half the Scale of the ship, then the System has been
    significantly Damaged. This increases the Difficulty of all Tasks that
    involve or are assisted by the ship&rsquo;s Engines by +2 until repaired.
    Further, the ship loses 1 Power at the end of every Round until this is
    repaired. The Difficulty to repair this is 3.</p>
