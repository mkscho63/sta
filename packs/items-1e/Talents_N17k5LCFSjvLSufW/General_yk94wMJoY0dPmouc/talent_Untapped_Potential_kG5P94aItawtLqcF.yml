    <p><strong>Requirements</strong>: Young Officer</p>

    <p>The character is inexperienced, but talented and with a bright future in
    Starfleet. The character may not have or increase any Attribute above 11, or
    any Discipline above 4 while they have this Talent (and may have to adjust
    Attributes and Disciplines accordingly at the end of character creation).
    Whenever the character succeeds at a Task for which they bought one or more
    additional dice with either Momentum or Threat, they may roll 1 Challenge
    Die. The character receives bonus Momentum equal to the roll of the
    Challenge Die, and adds one point to Threat if an Effect is rolled. The
    character cannot gain any higher rank than lieutenant (junior grade) while
    they possess this Talent.</p>
