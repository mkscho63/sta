    <p><strong>Requirement:</strong> Engineering 4+</p>

    <p>Whenever you attempt an <strong>Engineering </strong>Task to perform
    repairs, you may reduce the Difficulty by two, to a minimum of 0. If you do
    this, however, then the repairs are only temporary and will last only a
    single scene, plus one additional scene per Momentum spent (Repeatable)
    before they fail again. Jury-rigged repairs can only be applied once, and
    the Difficulty to repair a device that has been Jury-rigged increases by
    1.</p>
