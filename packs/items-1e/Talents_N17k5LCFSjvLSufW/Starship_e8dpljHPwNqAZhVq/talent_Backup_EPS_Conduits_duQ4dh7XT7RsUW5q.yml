    <p>The ship&rsquo;s power conduits have additional redundancies, which can
    be activated to reroute power more easily in case of an emergency, keeping
    it from being lost when the ship is damaged. Whenever the ship would lose
    one or more Power because of suffering damage, roll Challenge Dice for each
    Power lost. Each Effect rolled prevents the loss of that point of Power.</p>
