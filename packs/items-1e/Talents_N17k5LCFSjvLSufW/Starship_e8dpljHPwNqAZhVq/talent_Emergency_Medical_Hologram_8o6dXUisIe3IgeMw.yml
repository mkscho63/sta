    <p>The ship&rsquo;s sickbay is equipped with holoemitters and a
    stateof-the-art holographic doctor, able to assist medical personnel during
    emergencies. The ship has one additional Supporting Character, an Emergency
    Medical Hologram, using the Attributes, Disciplines, and so forth as shown
    in the sidebar, which does not cost any Crew Support to introduce, and which
    does not automatically improve when introduced. This character cannot go
    into any location not equipped with holoemitters.</p>
