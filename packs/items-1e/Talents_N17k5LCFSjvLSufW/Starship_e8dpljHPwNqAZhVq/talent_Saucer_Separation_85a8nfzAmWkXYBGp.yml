    <p>The ship is designed so that the saucer section can be separated from the
    engineering section, to operate as two distinct ships. Each section has the
    same Systems, Departments, Talents, and weapons, but their Scale is one
    lower than the whole ship (recalculate anything derived from Scale), and
    each section only has half the Power (round down) that the ship had before
    separation. Further, if the ship has suffered any damage, ongoing effects of
    that damage apply equally to both sections. The saucer section, which
    contains the crew quarters and recreational areas, does not have the
    capacity to go to warp.</p>

    <p>Separating is a <strong>Control + Conn</strong> Task with a Difficulty of
    3, assisted by the ship&rsquo;s <strong>Structure + Engineering</strong>,
    performed from the internal systems position or main engineering.
    Reconnecting requires the same Task with Difficulty 1, but from crew in both
    parts of the ship; if either Task fails, the reconnection fails. Separating
    and reconnection cannot be done if the Structure of either ship has been
    Damaged or Disabled.</p>
