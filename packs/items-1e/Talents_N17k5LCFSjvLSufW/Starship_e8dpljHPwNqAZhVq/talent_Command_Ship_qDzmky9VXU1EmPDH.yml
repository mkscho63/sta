    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Command 3+</p>

    <p>The ship has command and control systems allowing it to coordinate easily
    with allies during a crisis. When a character on the ship succeeds at a
    <em>Direct </em>Task to create an Advantage, they may always be assisted by
    the ship&rsquo;s <strong>Communications + Command</strong>, and they may
    confer the Advantage to allied ships or away teams with whom the ship
    maintains a communications link.</p>
