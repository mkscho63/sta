    <p>The vessel&rsquo;s shuttlebays are large, well-supplied, and able to
    support a larger number of active shuttle missions simultaneously. The ship
    may have twice as many small craft active at any one time as it would
    normally allow, and it may carry up to two Scale 2 small craft. For more on
    small craft operations, see p. 232.</p>
