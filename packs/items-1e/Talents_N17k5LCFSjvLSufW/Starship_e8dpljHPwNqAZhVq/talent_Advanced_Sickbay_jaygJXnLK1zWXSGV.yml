    <p>The ship&rsquo;s sickbay is extremely well-equipped, and larger than is
    normal for a ship of this size. The ship gains the Advanced Sickbay
    Advantage, which applies to all Tasks related to medicine and biology
    performed within the sickbay itself. This Advantage is lost if the
    ship&rsquo;s Computers System is Disabled.</p>
