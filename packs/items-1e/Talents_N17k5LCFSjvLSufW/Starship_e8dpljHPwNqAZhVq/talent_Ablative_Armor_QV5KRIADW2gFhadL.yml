    <p>The vessel&rsquo;s hull plating has an additional ablative layer that
    disintegrates slowly under extreme temperatures, such as those caused by
    energy weapons and torpedo blasts, dissipating the energy, and protecting
    the ship. This plating is replaced periodically. The ship&rsquo;s Resistance
    is increased by 2.</p>
