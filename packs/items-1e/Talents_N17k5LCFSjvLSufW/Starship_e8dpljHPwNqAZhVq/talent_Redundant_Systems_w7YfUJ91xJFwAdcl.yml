    <p>The ship has multiple additional redundancies that allow it to withstand
    severe damage more easily. Nominate a single System. When that system
    becomes Damaged or Disabled, the crew may choose to activate the backups as
    a Minor Action; if the System was Damaged, it is no longer Damaged. If it
    was Disabled, it becomes Damaged instead. A System&rsquo;s backups may only
    be activated once per adventure, so subsequent damage will have the normal
    effect.</p>
