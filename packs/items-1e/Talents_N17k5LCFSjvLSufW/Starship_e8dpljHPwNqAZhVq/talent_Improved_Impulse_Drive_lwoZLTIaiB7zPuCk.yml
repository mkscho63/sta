    <p>The ship&rsquo;s Impulse drives are more powerful than on most ships,
    allowing the ship to accelerate much more quickly. When the flight
    controller succeeds at the <em>Impulse</em>, <em>Attack Pattern</em>,
    <em>Evasive Action</em>, or <em>Ramming Speed</em> Tasks, they may spend 2
    Momentum to increase the Difficulty of attacks against the ship by 1 until
    the start of the flight controller&rsquo;s next Turn, due to the
    ship&rsquo;s rapid acceleration.</p>
