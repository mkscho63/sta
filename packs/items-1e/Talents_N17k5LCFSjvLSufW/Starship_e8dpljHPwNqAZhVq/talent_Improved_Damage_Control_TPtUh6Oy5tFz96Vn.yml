    <p>The ship has more efficient damage reporting systems, and better-trained
    teams of technicians, allowing the crew to respond more quickly to damage
    during a crisis. When a character takes the <em>Damage Control</em> Task
    aboard this ship, they may re-roll a single d20. If the repairs require an
    Extended Task, then the characters also gain Progression 1, adding +1 to
    Work done for each Effect rolled.</p>
