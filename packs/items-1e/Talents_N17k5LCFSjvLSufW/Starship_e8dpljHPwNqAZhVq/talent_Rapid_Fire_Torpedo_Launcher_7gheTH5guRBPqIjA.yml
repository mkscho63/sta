    <p>The vessel&rsquo;s torpedo launchers have been redesigned to allow the
    ship to fire multiple torpedoes much more quickly and accurately. Whenever
    the crew add 3 to Threat to fire a torpedo salvo, they may re-roll a single
    d20 on the attack, and any number of Challenge Dice on the damage roll.</p>
