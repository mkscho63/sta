    <p><strong>Requirement:</strong> Betazoid, or Gamemaster&rsquo;s Permission.
    Character creation only.</p>

    <p>You can sense the surface thoughts and emotions of most living beings
    nearby, and can communicate telepathically with other empaths and telepaths,
    as well as those with whom you are extremely familiar. Surface thoughts are
    whatever a creature is thinking about at that precise moment. The character
    cannot choose not to sense the emotions or read the surface thoughts of
    those nearby, except for those who are resistant to telepathy. It will
    require effort and a Task to pick out the emotions or thoughts of a specific
    individual in a crowd, to search a creature&rsquo;s mind for specific
    thoughts or memories, or to block out the minds of those nearby. Unwilling
    targets may resist with an Opposed Task.</p>
