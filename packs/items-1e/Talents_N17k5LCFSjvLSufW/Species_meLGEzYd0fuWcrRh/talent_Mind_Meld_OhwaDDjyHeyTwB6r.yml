    <p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Vulcan.</p>

    <p>You have undergone training in telepathic techniques that allow the
    melding of minds through physical contact. This will always require a Task
    with a Difficulty of at least 1, which can be opposed by an unwilling
    participant. If successful, you link minds with the participant, sharing
    thoughts and memories; Momentum may be spent to gain more information, or
    perform deeper telepathic exchanges. This link goes both ways, and it is a
    tiring and potentially hazardous process for you. Complications can result
    in pain, disorientation, or lingering emotional or behavioral
    difficulties.</p>
