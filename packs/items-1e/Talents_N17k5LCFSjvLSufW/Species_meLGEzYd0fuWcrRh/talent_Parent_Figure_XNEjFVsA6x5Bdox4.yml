    <p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Denobulan, or Gamemaster&rsquo;s
    permission.</p>

    <p>You have a large family, with many children, nieces, and nephews, and
    you&rsquo;ve learned how to coordinate even the most unruly and fractious of
    groups when necessary. When attempting or assisting a Task, and two or more
    other characters are involved in the Task, the first Complication generated
    on the Task &mdash; either by the character attempting the Task, or one of
    the assistants &mdash; may be ignored.</p>
