    <p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Bajoran, or Gamemaster&rsquo;s
    permission.</p>

    <p>You have received a vision from the Bajoran Prophets, through one of the
    Orbs. This rare experience, though confusing at first, has shaped your life
    and outlook. You have one additional Value, reflecting the insights you
    received from the experience. The first time this Value is Challenged, roll
    1 Challenge Die; if an Effect is rolled, then some foretold element of the
    Orb Experience has come to pass, and the Value is not crossed out as it
    would normally be.</p>
