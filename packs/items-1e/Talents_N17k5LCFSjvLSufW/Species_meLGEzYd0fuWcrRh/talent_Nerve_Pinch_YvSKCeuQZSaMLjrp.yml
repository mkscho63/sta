    <p>You have learned numerous techniques for the stimulation and control of
    nerve impulses &mdash; collectively called neuropressure. Some applications
    of neuropressure can be used to swiftly and non-lethally incapacitate
    assailants. The nerve pinch counts as a melee weapon with 1 Challenge Die,
    Size 1H, and the Intense and Non-lethal qualities. You may use Science or
    Medicine instead of Security when attempting a nerve pinch Attack, and may
    increase damage by your Science or Medicine Discipline instead of
    Security</p>
