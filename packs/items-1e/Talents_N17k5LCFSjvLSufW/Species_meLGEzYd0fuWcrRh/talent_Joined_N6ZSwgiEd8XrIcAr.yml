    <p><strong>Requirement:</strong> Trill, requires Gamemaster&rsquo;s
    permission to take this Talent after Character Creation.</p>

    <p>You have a symbiont, with lifetimes of memories to draw upon. Once per
    mission, you may declare that a former host had expertise in a relevant
    skill or field of study; you gain a single Focus for the remainder of the
    scene, as you draw upon those memories. Additionally, you gain a Trait with
    the name of the Symbiont; this reflects potential advantages of the Joining,
    the ability to perform rites and rituals to awaken past hosts&rsquo;
    memories, and the vulnerabilities inherent in the connection. Former
    Initiate cannot be taken if the character has the Joined Talent &mdash; they
    are mutually exclusive.</p>
