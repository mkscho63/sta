    <p>The operations manager manages and oversees all technical operations
    aboard or involving the ship, normally from the Operations station on the
    Bridge, or in conjunction with the chief engineer (on smaller ships, one
    officer may fill both roles). This often entails taking on the duties of a
    science officer, if there is no dedicated science officer in the senior
    staff.</p>

    <p>When the operations manager succeeds at a Task assisted by the
    ship&rsquo;s Computers or Sensors, or using a tricorder, the character
    generates one bonus Momentum, which may only be used on the Obtain
    Information Momentum Spend.</p>
