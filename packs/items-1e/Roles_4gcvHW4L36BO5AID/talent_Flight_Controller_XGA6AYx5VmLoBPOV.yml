    <p>Not a typical senior staff role, some captains, particularly those
    operating in uncharted space, choose the most senior helmsman or flight
    control officer to serve as senior staff as well.</p>

    <p>When the flight controller is required to analyze or repair technology
    related to flight or propulsion, they may use the Conn Discipline instead of
    Engineering.</p>
