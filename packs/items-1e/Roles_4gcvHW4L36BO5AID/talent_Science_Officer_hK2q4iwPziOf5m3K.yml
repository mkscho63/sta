    <p>A science officer is responsible for advising the commanding officer of
    all matters scientific, providing hypotheses in matters concerning the
    unknown. Not all ships have a dedicated science officer within the senior
    staff, often having the operations manager take on these duties.</p>

    <p>When the science officer succeeds at a Task assisted by the ship&rsquo;s
    Computers or Sensors, or using a tricorder, the character generates one
    bonus Momentum, which may only be used on the <em>Obtain Information</em>
    Momentum Spend.</p>
