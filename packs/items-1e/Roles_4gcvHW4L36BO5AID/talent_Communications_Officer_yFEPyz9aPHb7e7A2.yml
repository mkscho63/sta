    <p>More common in the earlier days of Starfleet, dedicated communications
    officers are typically skilled in linguistics and cryptography, and aided
    with advanced translation and decryption technologies, and thus valuable
    during encounters with both new cultures, and with hostile ones.</p>

    <p>When a Task attempted by the communications officer is increased in
    Difficulty because of an unfamiliar language or encryption, ignore that
    Difficulty increase.</p>
