    <p><strong>Standard Issue</strong></p>

    <p>All characters naturally receive their uniforms. The precise style of
    uniform will vary based on the era, and on the preferences of the Commanding
    Officer. Individual characters may have alterations or additional elements
    on their uniforms &mdash; such as a devotional earring for Bajorans, or a
    lab coat for medical personnel &mdash; as required. Characters will receive
    duty uniforms appropriate for their department and their duties, as well as
    a dress uniform for formal occasions.</p>
