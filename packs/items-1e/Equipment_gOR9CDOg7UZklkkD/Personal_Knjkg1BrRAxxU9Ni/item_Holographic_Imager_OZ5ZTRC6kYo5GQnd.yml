    <p><strong>Opportunity 1</strong></p>

    <p>Imaging technology has improved dramatically since the invention of the
    photographic camera. The current state of the art imaging device is the
    holographic imager, a hand-held multi-spectral camera capable of recording
    nearly unlimited still and moving images with a resolution down to the
    micron level. Use of the device can range from recording happy memories from
    the latest shore leave all the way to recording the behaviors of a new
    life-form on a newly charted planet. The devices output is detailed enough
    that the recorded data can be used to recreate the setting inside holodecks,
    allowing for accurate computer simulations.</p>
