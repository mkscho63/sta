    <p><strong>Opportunity 1</strong></p>

    <p>A standard part of Starfleet communicators since the late 23rd century,
    the universal translator was originally invented before the EarthRomulan War
    and has been an integral part of Federation diplomacy ever since. Characters
    not possessing a universal translator, either through destruction or removal
    of a communicator, will be unable to converse with beings that do not
    understand the character&rsquo;s languages past basic hand gestures.
    Obtaining a separate universal translator provides the character with a
    stand-alone unit, typically more powerful than the versions found in
    communicators.</p>
