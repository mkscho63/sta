    <p><strong>Opportunity 2</strong></p>

    <p>The anti-grav sled resembles a small cart without wheels. On the bottom
    of the device there are multiple graviton emitters that counter the local
    gravity field, effectively making the sled and any items placed on it nearly
    weightless, though not massless. In a natural gravity field the sled is less
    efficient, while on a vessel that has gravity plating, the sled interacts
    with the ships computer to lower the artificial gravity around the sled,
    allowing more mass to be moved and for a longer operational timespan.
    Versions which double as stretchers for transporting injured personnel are
    often used in sickbays and hospitals.</p>
