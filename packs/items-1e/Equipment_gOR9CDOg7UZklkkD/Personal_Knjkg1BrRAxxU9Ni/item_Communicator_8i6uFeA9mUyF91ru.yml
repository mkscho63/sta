    <p><strong>Standard Issue</strong></p>

    <p>The standard Starfleet communicator is a ubiquitous piece of technology.
    During the 22nd and 23rd centuries, these devices were hand held and allowed
    the user to communicate with a starship in orbit or another communicator
    broadcasting on the same series of sub-space channels. By the 24th century
    the communicator was further miniaturized with the introduction of isolinear
    technologies, making it small enough to be worn as a pin on the uniform, as
    well as allowing constant contact with a starships main computer and the
    ability to communicate directly with any other crew member wearing a similar
    device. The 23rd and 24th century versions of these devices also include a
    small, but complex universal translator.</p>
