    <p><strong>Standard Issue</strong></p>

    <p>&lsquo;Tricorder&rsquo; is the label given to a class of versatile
    devices in use across the Federation. Their name is derived from the
    original early 22nd century name for the device, &lsquo;Tri-function
    Recorder,&rsquo; able to sense, record, and analyze data from a variety of
    sensors attached to the device, dependent on the primary use. During the
    23rd century there were two primary versions of the Starfleet tricorder
    (science and medical), and a single highly specialized version (the
    psychotricorder). The psychotricorder was primarily used by psychologists
    and law enforcement agencies as a device to more accurately determine a
    humanoid&rsquo;s behavioral and emotional state, aiding in helping
    physicians provide accurate diagnoses of trauma and useful treatments. Law
    enforcement would use these devices as a way to determine truthfulness of
    statements or in aiding officers in finding mentally disturbed individuals.
    The more common medical and science tricorders only differed in the range
    and scope of their sensors and ability to use tricorder attachments. The
    medical tricorder typically had fewer sensors and a shorter range as a
    tradeoff for higher resolution scans more specialized towards biological
    functions and a greater capacity for specialist attachments. The science
    tricorder had a large multi-discipline database and a built in sub-space
    uplink that could connect to nearby Starfleet vessels for main computer
    access when needed. By the 24th century tricorders were unified into a
    single design as data storage and sensor design was further miniaturized by
    the development of isolinear computing technologies, even including more
    specialist analysis capabilities for engineering teams. Without a tricorder,
    Starfleet crewmembers would have difficulty diagnosing medical ailments,
    engineering glitches, or scientific curiosities</p>
