    <p><strong>Opportunity 1</strong></p>

    <p>The standard Starfleet emergency surgical kit provides single use medical
    supplies capable of allowing a trained physician the means to perform
    complex surgical procedures in the field at the expense of equipment
    durability. The casing contains a builtin PADD that gives readouts on basic
    biological functions important to physicians such as blood pressure,
    heartbeat, temperature, etc. The display will also walk even unskilled
    civilians through steps to triage injured humanoids. An emergency surgical
    kit is a single-use item, its resources expended after use.</p>
