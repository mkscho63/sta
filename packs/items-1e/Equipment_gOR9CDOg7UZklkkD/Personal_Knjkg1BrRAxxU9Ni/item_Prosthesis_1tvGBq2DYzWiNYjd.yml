  description: >-
    <p>Like artificial organs, prosthetic limbs have been in use since the
    middle of the 20th century, and advances in technology mean that they
    function identically to the limbs they replace. Arms and legs lost due to
    trauma can be replaced with relatively little difficulty. Characters who are
    lacking their prosthetic may find their physical activities are impaired,
    making some Tasks more difficult, and others impossible.</p>
