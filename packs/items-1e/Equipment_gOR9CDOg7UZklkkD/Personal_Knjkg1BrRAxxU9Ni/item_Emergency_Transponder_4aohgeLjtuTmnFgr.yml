    <p><strong>Opportunity 1</strong></p>

    <p>Also known by transporter operation officers as &lsquo;The
    Screamer&rsquo;, emergency transponders are small hand-held devices capable
    of transmitting very strong sub-space singles with limited amounts of data.
    This data usually consists of just a waveguide that allows starship sensors
    to detect the transmitter from light-years away when there is no
    interference, and from AU&rsquo;s away with sub-space background scattering.
    While this does not allow for transporter systems to lock onto and beam a
    person using the transponder from distances or through material it normally
    wouldn&rsquo;t (without the aid of pattern enhancers), it does allow for
    high accuracy in transports and acts as a SOS signal recognized by most
    governments across the Alpha and Beta quadrants. Characters using an
    emergency transponder gain the ability to show their position to any vessel
    currently using sub-space sensors within a radius determined by the GM, but
    usually very long distances measuring between a few hundred thousand
    kilometers and light-years.</p>
