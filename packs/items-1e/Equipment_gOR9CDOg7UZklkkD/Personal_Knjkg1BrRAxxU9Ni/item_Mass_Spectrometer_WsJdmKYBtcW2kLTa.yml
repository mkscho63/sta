    <p><strong>Opportunity 1</strong></p>

    <p>A mass spectrometer is a device that can take a sample of material, break
    it down, and provide an incredible amount of detail about the matter making
    it up. While tricorders can provide data similar to this, the mass
    spectrometers found in engineering sections on starships and specialist
    devices dedicated to this task are able to provide details on a sample that
    may be too broad to detect with other devices, such as: getting the accurate
    age of a sample to within months from carbon dating or a couple of years
    with other radio-isotope dating techniques, elemental quantities to the
    parts per quadrillion, and even breakdown of sub-atomic particle
    deviations.</p>
