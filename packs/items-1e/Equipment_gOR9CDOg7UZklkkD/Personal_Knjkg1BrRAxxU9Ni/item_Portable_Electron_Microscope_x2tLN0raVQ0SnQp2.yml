    <p><strong>Opportunity 1</strong></p>

    <p>The portable electron microscope is a name used for any electronic device
    capable of scanning and imaging objects as small as atomic nuclei,
    regardless of the sub-atomic particle used. Unlike their larger counter
    parts, the portable scope is small enough to be carried by an away team
    member trained in its use and doesn&rsquo;t have the resolution or power to
    image and analyze sub-atomic particles and quantum structures. These devices
    are commonly connected to tricorders used by the engineering department to
    help find structural flaws in bulkheads and hull plating.</p>
