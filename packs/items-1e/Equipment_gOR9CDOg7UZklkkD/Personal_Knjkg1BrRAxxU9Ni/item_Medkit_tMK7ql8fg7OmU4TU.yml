    <p><strong>Standard Issue for Starfleet medical personnel, Opportunity 1 for
    non-medical personnel</strong></p>

    <p>If a character is in sickbay at the time a specific medical device is
    required, reduce the Opportunity Cost by 1, to a minimum of 0. A few of the
    items listed below are considered part of a standard medkit, which is
    standard issue for all Starfleet medical personnel. A medkit has a Cost of
    Opportunity 1 for non-medical personnel.</p>

    <p><strong>Anabolic Protoplaser/Dermal Regenerator (Part of Medkit)</strong>
    A common tool in first aid kits on Starfleet vessels, the dermal regenerator
    allows a physician to stimulate an injured humanoid's natural healing
    process to accelerate the production of new skin cells and connective
    tissue, effectively healing superficial wounds.</p>

    <p><strong>Hypospray (Part of Medkit):</strong> In use since before the
    Eugenics Wars on Earth in the 1990s, hypospray devices provide a high speed
    and efficient means to deliver drugs that would normally have to be given by
    hypodermic needle or IV drip. Hyposprays in the 23rd century and beyond have
    improved far beyond those early models and are able to deliver drugs in a
    much more efficient way to the patient.</p>

    <p><strong>Tri-laser Connector (Part of Medkit):</strong> Used to heal and
    repair damaged neurons and nerve tissue, the tri-laser connector uses laser
    light to stimulate a projected stream of stem cells to specialize into
    predetermined neural pathways. With a detailed enough scan of a patient,
    such as one provided by transporter systems, the tri-laser connector is able
    to repair and reconstruct damaged brain tissue with little to no detectable
    differences in the patient&rsquo;s cognitive functions if undertaken within
    days of the last scan.</p>
