    <p><strong>Standard Issue for Engineers, Opportunity 1
    otherwise</strong></p>

    <p>Beginning with the introduction of duotronic computing in the mid-23rd
    century, analysis of engineering faults in systems controlled by electronics
    became more difficult due to the high-energy transfer rates and EM
    interference. The engineering multitool was developed and acted as a
    tricorder like device to detect and diagnose system faults and could be used
    in a general role as a multi-purpose tool to repair and maintain systems.
    With the advent of isolinear systems, the multi-tool was rendered obsolete
    and many of the uses of the device were supplanted by the tricorder, but
    tools were still needed to maintain and repair damaged equipment, so the
    Starfleet engineering tool-kit was introduced to provide nearly every tool a
    damage control or engineering team may need outside of unusual
    circumstances.</p>
