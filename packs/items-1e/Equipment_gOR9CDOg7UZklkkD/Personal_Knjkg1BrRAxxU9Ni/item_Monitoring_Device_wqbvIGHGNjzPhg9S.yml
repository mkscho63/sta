    <p>The heartbeat reader is a small device that can connect to a medical
    tricorder or a sick bay bio-bed. This device, placed on the patient, is able
    to scan a life-form, determine the function of a single vital organ or
    biological function, and what the physiology of the life-form suggests are
    normal readings for that organ or function.</p>
