    <p>Using cutting edge neurological reconditioning and isolinear networks
    overlaid into a patient&rsquo;s sensory cortex, artificial sensory organs
    can replace damaged or destroyed senses. This can mean the blind can see,
    the deaf can hear, and even nerve damaged fingers can once again feel.
    Depending on when exactly the ASO is built (from about 2350 onwards) the
    technology can look highly artificial or barely noticeable at all. This
    technology is highly individual and includes sensors and other devices a
    person may find useful in their life. It takes years to learn to control the
    other functions besides the basic sensory input. A Player whose character
    has an artificial sensory organ should work with the Gamemaster to determine
    the functionality, look, and usefulness in certain situations of the ASO. It
    is recommended that while these devices can be advantageous (such as
    artificial eyes being able to scan across the entire EM spectrum, or touch
    sensors being able to analyze a surfaces&rsquo; composition), there are
    potential disadvantages too, such as needing to charge the device
    periodically, headaches due to data transfer, or the risk of the device
    being lost or damaged</p>
