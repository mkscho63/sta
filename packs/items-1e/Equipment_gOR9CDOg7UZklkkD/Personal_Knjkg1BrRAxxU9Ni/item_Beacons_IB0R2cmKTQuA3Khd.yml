    <p>Like most battery powered light sources dating back to the 20th century,
    the standard issue Starfleet beacon has a wider range of functions including
    changing the frequency of the light emitted from the near infrared to
    long-wave ultraviolet or providing a &lsquo;white&rsquo; light for species
    that evolved with different natural light. Beacons can also be set to emit
    entirely in the near infrared, providing a short-term heat source in a
    survival situation. Standard Starfleet beacons are worn on the wrist and are
    held in place with a strap, but also can be hand-held, mounted on helmets,
    or fitted to phaser type-3.</p>
