    <p>The &lsquo;Personal Access Display Device&rsquo; allows Starfleet crew to
    access the database of the starship or starbase they are currently serving
    on, tying them into the sub-space network stretching across the Federation.
    This gives a user as much data access as they have clearance for, access to
    sub-space communication and the ability to record and transmit text, audio,
    and video recordings to anyone in the Federation. The primary role of a PADD
    on a starship is to replace paper books, manuals, technical journals, and
    act as a personal scheduler and as an aid to complete administrative work.
    While nowhere near as powerful or complex as the main computer system on a
    starship, a PADD is able to process and analyze data by itself, or serve as
    an extension of a main computer to which it is connected.</p>
