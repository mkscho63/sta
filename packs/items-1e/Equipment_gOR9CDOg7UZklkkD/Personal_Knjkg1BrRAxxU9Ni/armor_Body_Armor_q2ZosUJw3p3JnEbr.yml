    <p>Body Armor has been issued periodically to Starfleet security at various
    times in Starfleet&rsquo;s history. In the late 23rd century, it took the
    form of a bulky vest and helmet, designed to absorb and disperse impacts and
    energy attacks. By the 24th century, ablative body armor is used mainly by
    personnel engaged in protracted conflict.</p>
