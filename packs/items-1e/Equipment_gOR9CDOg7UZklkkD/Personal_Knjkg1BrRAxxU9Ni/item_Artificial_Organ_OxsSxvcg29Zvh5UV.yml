  description: >-
    <p>Artificial organs have been in use since the mid-20th century. Advances
    in neuron meshing and cybernetics have improved these devices since their
    introduction and have made them virtually identical in capability to
    biological ones. The most common internal organs in humanoids to be replaced
    are hearts and lungs, nearly always because of severe trauma. Characters who
    need an artificial organ and do not possess them will die within minutes to
    days depending on the organ and are typically kept on life support while one
    is built. A character may have an artificial organ if they have been
    severely injured in the past.</p>
