    <p><strong>Opportunity 1, Escalation 2</strong></p>

    <p>These personal shields were sometimes issued to security and combat
    personnel, though the power requirements of such devices mean they have
    limited use in protracted fighting. A character with a personal force field
    gains the listed Resistance, but must roll 1 Challende Die after each time
    they are hit by an attack; if an Effect is rolled, the force field loses
    power for the rest of the scene, and no longer provides Resistance.</p>
