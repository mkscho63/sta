    <p><strong>Standard Issue for Communications Officer, Opportunity 1
    otherwise</strong></p>

    <p>The Starfleet ear receiver has fallen out of favor since the 23rd
    century, but still can be seen in use by specialists in communication
    technologies, lingual, and other aural sciences. The ear receiver ties
    directly into shipboard communication networks and allows the user to listen
    to data coming across both sub-space frequencies typically used for
    long-range communication and ship to surface, but also listening to computer
    alerts and data so as not to distract others at nearby stations with the
    chatter. The receiver can also be programmed to provide aural or vibrational
    feedback to users allowing sensor operators greater accuracy in their
    duties.</p>
