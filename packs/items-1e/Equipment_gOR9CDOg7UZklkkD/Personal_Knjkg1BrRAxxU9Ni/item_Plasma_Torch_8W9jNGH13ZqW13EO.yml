    <p><strong>Opportunity 1</strong></p>

    <p>Plasma torches are high energy cutting tools powered by an integral
    energy cell and a compressed helium matter source. The helium is
    super-heated and ionized before being focused by a magnetic field into a
    microscopic beam, allowing the beam to cut through all but the strongest of
    materials. Dependent on availability, other gases and energy sources are
    used with the same capabilities</p>
