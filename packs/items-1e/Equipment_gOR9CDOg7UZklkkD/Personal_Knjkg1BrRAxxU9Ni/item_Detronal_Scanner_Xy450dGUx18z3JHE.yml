    <p><strong>Opportunity 1</strong></p>

    <p>The advances in molecular and atomic scanning as well as computing power
    allowed the development of hand-held genetic analysis devices such as the
    detronal scanner. This device allows a trained physician to scan the skin
    and deeper layers of tissue of a humanoid and perform an analysis of the
    patient&rsquo;s genome. If the patient is of a known and previously studied
    species, the device can also provide analysis of any genetic drift or damage
    due to external sources.</p>
