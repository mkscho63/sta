  description: >-
    <p>Photon torpedoes use a simple payload of matter and anti-matter to create
    a large and devastating explosion. They&rsquo;re commonly used by many
    cultures, including the Klingons, the Cardassians, and the Federation. They
    have a base Damage of 3 Challenge Dice, with the High-Yield Quality.</p>

    <p>Torpedoes may be fired in a salvo: a volley of several torpedoes,
    intended to have a much greater effect. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds 2
    Threat to the pool, along with the 1 point of Threat for a torpedo attack,
    for a total of 3 Threat. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds +3 to Threat
    instead of +1, but it increases the attack&rsquo;s damage by +1 Challenge
    Die, and grants the Spread effect to the attack.</p>

    <p><strong>High-Yield:</strong> The weapon inflicts massive damage to enemy
    vessels; if the Attack inflicts one or more Breaches to a system, it
    inflicts one additional Breach.</p>

    <p><strong>Spread:</strong> The Attack inflicts additional damage elsewhere
    on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the Attack inflicts one
    additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was targeting a
    specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial hit, rounding
    up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This additional hit is
    resolved separately, and each hit against the target is reduced by
    Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes Breaches,
    individually</p>
