    <p>Used by Klingon and Romulan vessels, disruptors are potent weapons that
    inflict grievous damage.</p>

    <p>Cannons are close range, rapid-firing weapons that project pulses or
    bolts of energy rather than consistent beams. These are inaccurate at longer
    ranges, but the volley of quick pulses can be devastating. Cannons have a
    Range category of close, and increase the weapon&rsquo;s damage by +2
    Challenge Dice.</p>

    <p><strong>Vicious 1:</strong> The Attack inflicts 1 additional damage for
