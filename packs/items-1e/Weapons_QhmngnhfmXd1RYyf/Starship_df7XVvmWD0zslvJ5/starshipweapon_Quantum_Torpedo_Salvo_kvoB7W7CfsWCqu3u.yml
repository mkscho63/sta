    <p>Quantum torpedoes are a recent development by the Federation, though
    others have made similar developments. They&rsquo;re more powerful than
    photon torpedoes, though the way they achieve this is classified. They have
    a base Damage of 4 Challenge Dice Vicious 1, with the Calibration and
    High-Yield Qualities.</p>

    <p>Torpedoes may be fired in a salvo: a volley of several torpedoes,
    intended to have a much greater effect. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds 2
    Threat to the pool, along with the 1 point of Threat for a torpedo attack,
    for a total of 3 Threat. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds +3 to Threat
    instead of +1, but it increases the attack&rsquo;s damage by +1 Challenge
    Die, and grants the Spread effect to the attack.</p>

    <p><strong>Calibration:</strong> The weapon requires careful calibration
    before firing. The weapon cannot be used to attack unless a <em>Prepare
    </em>Minor Action is performed during the same Turn.</p>

    <p><strong>High-Yield:</strong> The weapon inflicts massive damage to enemy
    vessels; if the Attack inflicts one or more Breaches to a system, it
    inflicts one additional Breach.</p>

    <p><strong>Spread: </strong>The Attack inflicts additional damage elsewhere
    on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the Attack inflicts one
    additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was targeting a
    specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial hit, rounding
    up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This additional hit is
    resolved separately, and each hit against the target is reduced by
    Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes Breaches,
    individually.</p>
