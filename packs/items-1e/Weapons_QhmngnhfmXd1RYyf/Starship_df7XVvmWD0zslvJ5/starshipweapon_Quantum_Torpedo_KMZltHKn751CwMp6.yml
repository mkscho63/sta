    <p>Quantum torpedoes are a recent development by the Federation, though
    others have made similar developments. They&rsquo;re more powerful than
    photon torpedoes, though the way they achieve this is classified. They have
    a base Damage of 4 Challenge Dice Vicious 1, with the Calibration and
    High-Yield Qualities.</p>

    <p><strong>Calibration:</strong> The weapon requires careful calibration
    before firing. The weapon cannot be used to attack unless a <em>Prepare
    </em>Minor Action is performed during the same Turn.</p>

    <p><strong>High-Yield:</strong> The weapon inflicts massive damage to enemy
    vessels; if the Attack inflicts one or more Breaches to a system, it
    inflicts one additional Breach.</p>
