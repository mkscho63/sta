    <p>Common to Starfleet and Cardassian vessels, phasers are a precise and
    adaptable weapon.</p>

    <p>Cannons are close range, rapid-firing weapons that project pulses or
    bolts of energy rather than consistent beams. These are inaccurate at longer
    ranges, but the volley of quick pulses can be devastating. Cannons have a
    Range category of close, and increase the weapon&rsquo;s damage by +2
    Challenge Dice.</p>

    <p><strong>Versatile 2:</strong> The attack gains 2 points of bonus Momentum
    if successful.</p>
