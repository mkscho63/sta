    <p>Used mainly by the starships of the Dominion, Phased polaron weapons are
    especially effective at overwhelming deflector shields.</p>

    <p>Arrays are long strips of linked emitters that share a power feed,
    allowing the ship to fire from any point along the strip. This allows the
    ship to fire in multiple directions at once, or to adjust and fire on moving
    targets repeatedly in quick succession. Arrays have a Range category of
    medium. Further, when declaring the target of an attack with an Array, the
    attacking character may choose to grant one of the Area or Spread effects to
    the attack.</p>

    <p><strong>Area:</strong> The attack affects a wider area, and can affect
    several targets at once. The attack automatically affects any vessel or
    damageable object within Contact of the initial target, and then one
    additional target within close range of the initial target for each Effect
    rolled, starting with the next closest (as determined by the GM). If one or
    more Complications is rolled when using an Area attack, the GM may choose to
    use Complications to have an allied vessel or neutral bystander in the area
    affected by the attack. A target cannot be hit if it would have been more
    difficult to hit than the initial target.</p>

    <p><strong>Piercing 2:</strong> The attack ignores 2 points of the
    target&rsquo;s total Resistance for each Effect rolled.</p>
