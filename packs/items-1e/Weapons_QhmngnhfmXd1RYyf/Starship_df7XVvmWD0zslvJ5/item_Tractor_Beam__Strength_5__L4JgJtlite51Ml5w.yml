    <p>The tactical officer engages a tractor beam at a nearby object or vessel.
    This requires a <strong>Control + Security</strong> Task, assisted by the
    ship&rsquo;s <strong>Structure + Security</strong> with a Difficulty of 2,
    and can only be directed at a target within close range. If successful, the
    target vessel is immobilized and cannot move unless it can break free, using
    their shield modulations, the raw power of their engines, or disabling the
    tractor beam emitter (a Task in its own right), with a Difficulty of 5.</p>
