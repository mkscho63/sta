  description: >-
    <p><strong>Pulse Grenades</strong> work on a similar principle to hand
    phasers. The user selects a setting and a countdown timer. When the timer
    reaches zero, the grenade discharges its power cell at once in all
    directions. After discharge, the grenade&rsquo;s components burn out,
    rendering them inert to prevent them being reused. Pulse grenades cover a
    number of similar technologies used throughout Starfleet&rsquo;s history
    &mdash; from the stun grenades used by United Earth MACO forces, to photon
    grenades employed in the 24th century.</p>

    <p>The weapon is a throwable explosive or energetic device, normally carried
    in small quantities. It cannot be used to make attacks against an enemy at
    Long or Extreme range. A character with a Grenade weapon has sufficient
    grenades to make three attacks with it during a scene.</p>
