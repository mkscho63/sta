    <p>Phaser Type-3, or phaser rifles, are higher-powered weapons designed for
    hazardous situations and combat. In addition to a larger power supply, they
    have numerous targeting and beam-focusing systems that make them more
    accurate. They are only issued to properly-trained personnel, and only when
    necessary.</p>
