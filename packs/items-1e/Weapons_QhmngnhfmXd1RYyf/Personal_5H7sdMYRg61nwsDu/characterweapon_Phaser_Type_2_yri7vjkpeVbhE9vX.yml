    <p><strong>Standard Issue</strong></p>

    <p>Phaser Type-2 refers to the larger form of hand phaser, carried by
    security personnel and Starfleet officers going into dangerous environments.
    Versions used in the 23rd century are a pistol grip attachment that can be
    fitted to a phaser type-1, with a secondary power cell to increase output.
    24th century hand phasers are a distinct design, with a curved ergonomic
    grip.</p>
