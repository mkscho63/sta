    <p>Andorian plasma rifles use similar principles to phasers used by
    Starfleet with a particle beam as the primary effect. What is different is
    the particle beam is augmented by an encapsulated plasma discharge that
    always causes thermal damage to a target. This means that Andorian style
    plasma rifles are unable to cause a stun effect, and at best can knock a
    humanoid unconscious through pain.</p>
