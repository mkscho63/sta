  description: >-
    <p>While not really equipment, every character has the means to make an
    unarmed attack, striking with fists, feet, knees, elbows, head, or otherwise
    using brute force without a weapon. Countless martial arts, such as Klingon
    <em>mok&rsquo;bara</em>, Vulcan <em>suus mahna</em>, and Human styles like
    boxing or <em>aikido</em>, exist to allow individuals to hone their ability
    to disable foes without weapons</p>
