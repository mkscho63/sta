  description: >-
    <p>Bladed weapons such as the knife or dagger continue to be useful as tools
    or for close combat situations. While projectile weapons and later energy
    weapons have surpassed the destructive power of hand weapons, developments
    over the centuries in materials science have given these weapons continued
    use in nearly every service as backup weapons or as tools that can be used
    in lieu of more specialist equipment.</p>
