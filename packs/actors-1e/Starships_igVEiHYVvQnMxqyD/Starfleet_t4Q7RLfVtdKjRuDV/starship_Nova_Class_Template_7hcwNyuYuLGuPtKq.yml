    <p><strong>Entered Service:</strong> 2368</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Starfleet Command and the Federation Science
    Council formed a committee in 2363 to discuss the state of Starfleet&rsquo;s
    aging science and exploration vessels. While the Galaxy class was considered
    a success, the amount of personnel and resources required to construct one
    of the massive exploration cruisers was significant. The end conclusion of
    the committee was that Starfleet required a new science and exploration
    vessel that was small, easy to maintain, but had the best sensor and
    scientific equipment possible in a small spaceframe. The Nova class is the
    result, only entering service in the past few years.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong> The designers at Utopia Planitia Fleet
    Yards (UPFY) had been devising various next-generation designs for several
    years when work began on the Nova class. The science vessel was
    approximately the same size as the NX class from the 22nd century and had a
    similar amount of crew, typically requiring around 80 crew, depending on the
    assignment. Like many ships designed around this time, the Nova class had an
    integrated secondary hull under its wedge-like primary saucer, capitalizing
    on both the most recent theories on warp field dynamics and the faster
    manufacturing that this simpler cross-section would allow. However, though
    many next-generation technologies were in their infancy at the time, the
    designers chose to make use of tried, tested, and established components
    instead, continuing to use an isolinear processing system for both its
    primary and secondary computer cores and forgoing the use of variable
    geometry warp drive. The reasoning behind this was that the newer systems
    were still too bulky for the small vessel and tended to make simulated Nova
    designs far too cramped for even a bare minimum of crew members. Designers
    at UPFY nevertheless improved upon these basic components by increasing the
    strength of the warp field around both computer cores, improving the
    processing speeds by nearly doubling the field strength around the FTL
    elements. The warp coils needed for the starship were small, and engineers
    were able to place gimbal and gyroscopic control elements around each of the
    individual coils, giving the Nova class an even greater ability to modify
    the geometry of its warp field than any other starship of its mass at the
    cost of maintaining a steep field gradient, i.e. a lower maximum speed. To
    save space, UPFY engineers compressed the impulse systems into a single unit
    along the vessels spine and only installed forward facing torpedo systems.
    The type 10 phaser strips were short, reducing weapon arcs but giving the
    vessel more interior volume that could be utilized by life support and
    sensor systems rather than EPS transfer systems and heat exchangers. The
    small crew size and the slow cruising speed of the Nova class mean that its
    primary assignments are planetary survey and short to mid-range exploration
    missions lasting no more than six months before crews rotate to larger
    vessels or facilities.</p>

    <p>Since the launch of U.S.S. Nova in 2368, three Nova-class vessels have
    been destroyed or are presumed destroyed including Borealis, Equinox, and
    Zodiac. While the reason for the loss of Equinox in early 2371 is not yet
    known, it is thought to be due to a failure of the anti-matter containment
    systems when attempting to enter warp while under heavy sublight
    acceleration. This failure occurred in the other two starships, both in
    2371. UPFY engineers are currently studying these failures to determine if
    there are any serious flaws with the design itself; this may determine
    whether the Nova class has a future within Starfleet.</p>

        <p>Arrays are long strips of linked emitters that share a power feed,
        allowing the ship to fire from any point along the strip. This allows
        the ship to fire in multiple directions at once, or to adjust and fire
        on moving targets repeatedly in quick succession. Arrays have a Range
        category of Medium. Further, when declaring the target of an attack with
        an Array, the attacking character may choose to grant one of the Area or
        Spread effects to the attack.</p>

        <p><strong>Area:</strong> The attack affects a wider area, and can
        affect several targets at once. The attack automatically affects any
        vessel or damageable object within Contact of the initial target, and
        then one additional target within Close range of the initial target for
        each Effect rolled, starting with the next closest (as determined by the
        GM). If one or more Complications is rolled when using an Area attack,
        the GM may choose to use Complications to have an allied vessel or
        neutral bystander in the area affected by the attack. A target cannot be
        hit if it would have been more difficult to hit than the initial
        target.</p>

        <p><strong>Spread:</strong> The Attack inflicts additional damage

        inflicts one additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was
        targeting a specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial
        hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This
        additional hit is resolved separately, and each hit against the target
        is reduced by Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes
        Breaches, individually.</p>
