    <p><strong>Entered Service:</strong> 2274</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> During the mid to late 2260s the Federation
    saw increasing tensions with the Klingon Empire and many analysts thought
    that war was inevitable with Qo&rsquo;noS. The design of the Miranda class
    began as a dual-purpose patrol and combat vessel designed specifically to
    counter Klingon designs, specifically recent refits of the D7 battle
    cruiser. A combined team of designers from Starfleet Tactical and the
    Starfleet Advanced Technologies Group began co-opting and adjusting
    technologies and systems from the upcoming Constitution class refit,
    producing a heavily armed attack vessel just as peace broke out between the
    Federation and the Empire in 2267. Production of six spaceframes occurred
    before further manufacturing was halted while a complete redesign was
    undertaken. In 2272, the Miranda development group had beaten the sword into
    a plowshare by redesigning nearly 70% of the internal volume of the
    starship, attempting to make the vessel into a science and survey ship. The
    result was a highly adaptable starship that continues to be in use nearly
    one hundred years since its introduction.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong> The original design of the Miranda class
    had nearly double the amount of weapon systems as the Constitution class as
    well as two large shuttlebays at the aft of the starship. Many of these
    weapons were removed, leaving three phaser turrets each on the dorsal and
    ventral sections and two phasers mounted near the vessels impulse deck. A
    phaser turret on both the port and starboard &lsquo;roll-bar&rsquo;
    mountings was linked directly into the warp plasma conduits, increasing the
    firepower significantly at risk of depriving the starship of warp power at
    critical moments. In addition, a modular torpedo system was installed at the
    top of the vessels roll-bar, giving two forward and two rear facing launch
    tubes that could be quickly replaced with probe launchers. Some of the extra
    power requirements for weapon systems came from the ships compact shape,
    lacking a secondary hull, the Miranda could generate the same defensive
    shielding power as a Constitution class, but for only 70% of the power. The
    reduction in weapon systems also allowed many of the targeting systems to be
    replaced by more high-resolution long-range sensors suited for exploration
    duties. The large shuttle and cargo bays gave the starship an excellent
    reputation for performing highly detailed planetary surveys, being used for
    emergency cargo transportation, and a border patrol vessel. The adaptability
    of the modular systems of the Miranda class made it indispensable for
    assignments to frontier starbases where it could change its modules, and
    thus what assignments it could perform, with little layover time. This meant
    that a single Miranda could be assigned to a starbase rather than two or
    three specialized starships. By the mid-2280s the Miranda class was in use
    across the Federation and became the &lsquo;Jack-of-all-Trades&rsquo; of the
    Fleet, and an overworked one with many Miranda-class vessels logging more
    hours of continual operation than any others. While the Miranda class could
    never achieve the specialization of the Constitution class in exploration
    and science, nor the transport capabilities of the Ptolemy class, nor the
    sheer firepower of the larger, more advanced Excelsior class, it was used
    for all of these roles. The modular systems that were devised in the 2270s
    have made this class able to be easily refitted over the century of its
    service, and many of the starships still in active service today were
    exploring the Galaxy in the late 23rd century.</p>

        <p>Torpedoes may be fired in a salvo: a volley of several torpedoes,
        intended to have a much greater effect. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds
        2 Threat to the pool, along with the 1 point of Threat for a torpedo
        attack, for a total of 3 Threat. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds +3 to
        Threat instead of +1, but it increases the attack&rsquo;s damage by +1
        Challenge Die, and grants the Spread effect to the attack.</p>

        <p><strong>Spread:</strong> The Attack inflicts additional damage
        elsewhere on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the Attack
        inflicts one additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was
        targeting a specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial
        hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This
        additional hit is resolved separately, and each hit against the target
        is reduced by Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes
        Breaches, individually</p>
