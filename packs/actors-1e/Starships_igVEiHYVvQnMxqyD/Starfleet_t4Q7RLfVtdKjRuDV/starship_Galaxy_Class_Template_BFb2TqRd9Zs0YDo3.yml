    <p><strong>Entered Service:</strong> 2359</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Designed to be the best exploration and
    science vessel ever deployed by Starfleet, the Galaxy class was put into
    service with many of the most advanced technologies available in the late
    2350s along with its sister design, the Nebula class. It also represented a
    new philosophy in Starfleet where officers and crew on deep space and long
    duration assignments could bring along their families and loved ones rather
    than be apart from them for years. This philosophy meant the starship was
    one of the largest produced with often over 2000 crew and their family
    members aboard at any given time, and an emergency evacuation limit of
    around 15,000, but more typical crew levels numbered near 1000. While
    non-Starfleet personnel amounted to only between 15-20% of the total crew,
    each Galaxy-class starship had facilities and services onboard to serve
    Starfleet crew and civilians typically only seen on starbases including
    schools for children, bars and in some cases restaurants, day-care, and the
    largest holodecks produced at that time.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong> With much of the interior space of a
    Galaxy class empty and waiting for mission specific modules to be installed,
    each vessel quickly became unique compared to others of its class. Often the
    occupations of the vessel&rsquo;s civilians would dictate what kind of
    research facilities would be installed. As an example, the civilian husband
    of a serving science officer may be a metallurgist and request a facility
    able to handle the specialized needs of his smelting and fabrication
    research. This adaptability and capability for expansion also meant that
    these large vessels often ended up with a specialist for any situation, and
    civilian specialists that Starfleet required the expertise of would receive
    temporary rank and further space consideration for their facilities and
    hobbies onboard. Each Galaxy-class vessel had the largest warp core then
    produced by the Federation and designed by the Theoretical Propulsion Group
    of Mars. This powerplant provided the massive starship with the capability
    to maintain a cruising speed of warp 6 and an emergency velocity of warp
    9.8. Three identical isolinear computer cores with FTL processing
    capabilities tie the wide variety of scientific sensors, laboratories, and
    research facilities onboard together. These cores could each take over all
    computer needs on the ship in the case of the destruction of the other two.
    This meant that in the case of the destruction of the vessel, the data
    stored by a Galaxy-class starship could be pieced back together based on
    pieces recovered from each core. Unlike most Starfleet vessels before it,
    the Galaxy class was designed with the ability to separate and reattach its
    saucer without the need for a return to dry dock, allowing this use for both
    for emergency purposes and in tactical engagements such as when U.S.S.
    Enterprise NCC- 1701-D used the technique against the Borg following the
    Battle of Wolf 359 in 2367. Auxiliary shuttle craft are located in three
    separate shuttlebays, and typically include ten Type 6 or 7 personnel
    shuttles, ten type-9A cargo shuttles, and twelve type-15, 15A, or 16
    shuttlepods.</p>

        <p>Common to Starfleet and Cardassian vessels, phasers are a precise and

        <p>Arrays are long strips of linked emitters that share a power feed,
        allowing the ship to fire from any point along the strip. This allows
        the ship to fire in multiple directions at once, or to adjust and fire
        on moving targets repeatedly in quick succession. Arrays have a Range
        category of Medium. Further, when declaring the target of an attack with
        an Array, the attacking character may choose to grant one of the Area or
        Spread effects to the attack.</p>

        <p><strong>Area:</strong> The attack affects a wider area, and can
        affect several targets at once. The attack automatically affects any
        vessel or damageable object within Contact of the initial target, and
        then one additional target within Close range of the initial target for
        each Effect rolled, starting with the next closest (as determined by the
        GM). If one or more Complications is rolled when using an Area attack,
        the GM may choose to use Complications to have an allied vessel or
        neutral bystander in the area affected by the attack. A target cannot be
        hit if it would have been more difficult to hit than the initial
        target.</p>

        <p><strong>Versatile 2:</strong> The attack gains 2 points of bonus
        Momentum if successful.</p>

        <p><strong>Spread:</strong> The Attack inflicts additional damage
        elsewhere on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the Attack
        inflicts one additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was
        targeting a specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial
        hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This
        additional hit is resolved separately, and each hit against the target
        is reduced by Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes
        Breaches, individually.</p>

        the engineering section, to operate as two distinct ships. Each section
        has the same Systems, Departments, Talents, and weapons, but their Scale

        Scale), and each section only has half the Power (round down) that the
        ship had before separation. Further, if the ship has suffered any
        damage, ongoing effects of that damage apply equally to both sections.
        The saucer section, which contains the crew quarters and recreational
        areas, does not have the capacity to go to warp.</p>

        <p>Separating is a <strong>Control + Conn</strong> Task with a

        main engineering. Reconnecting requires the same Task with Difficulty 1,
        but from crew in both parts of the ship; if either Task fails, the
        reconnection fails. Separating and reconnection cannot be done if the
        Structure of either ship has been Damaged or Disabled.</p>
