    <p><strong>Entered Service:</strong> 2285</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Excelsior class was hailed as &lsquo;The
    Great Experiment&rsquo; by many scientists and engineers across the
    Federation. It was to be the first class of starship to utilize
    &lsquo;transwarp drive&rsquo; technology, a theoretical next step in
    propulsion technology that had shown repeated laboratory and simulated
    successes. The first attempted full-scale use of U.S.S. Excelsior and its
    transwarp systems in 2285 resulted in a complete failure of all propulsion
    systems from a combination of sabotage and failure of the vessel&rsquo;s
    capability to generate and maintain a transwarp field. The prototype was
    brought back into space dock for redesign using standard warp propulsion
    technologies, and by 2290 the &lsquo;bugs&rsquo; had been worked out of the
    design, resulting in a highly adaptable and capable starship for the late
    23rd century and beyond.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong> The ship-wide failure of U.S.S. Excelsior
    caused engineers at the San Francisco Ship Yards to overengineer nearly
    every system on the ship. The design&rsquo;s long transwarp nacelles were no
    longer needed after the failure of the experiment, but engineers elected to
    keep them so extra warp coils could be installed, giving the large starship
    both a robust warp field and a high maximum sustained warp speed.
    Excelsior-class vessels could often sustain dangerous warp speeds for
    periods long enough that the warp cores would overload or the ship&rsquo;s
    structural integrity field would begin to fail long before the coils
    themselves would begin to malfunction. Sublight propulsion was far in excess
    of what was needed, giving the massive cruiser accelerations typically seen
    on vessels half its size. The redundant fusion reactors also assisted in
    powering the ship&rsquo;s impressive shielding systems, capable of greater
    defensive power absorption than the Constitution class over a much greater
    surface area. Tactical systems were also improved over the older heavy
    cruiser, with five dual type-8 phaser banks on the primary hull, and a
    single dual bank tied directly into the impulse reactor array. Further, two
    phaser banks are located on either side of the &lsquo;neck&rsquo; connecting
    the primary and secondary hull, and a bank of phasers is located on the
    dorsal secondary hull between the warp nacelle pylons. Additionally, two
    forward and two aft mounted photon torpedo launchers gave the Excelsior
    class enough firepower to give pause to any commander of a hostile vessel
    encountering it, though at least one tube is kept loaded with probes while
    on exploratory and research assignments. The redesign also allowed the
    installation of the final generation of duotronic computer processors before
    the introduction of isolinear systems in the early 24th century. This gave
    Excelsior-class vessels unrivalled sensor and data processing abilities
    compared to other starships of its era. As the redesign of the class was so
    extensive, designers on the project ended up inadvertently ensuring the
    class would be in use even today with large sections of the primary and
    secondary hull able to be removed and replaced with the systems they
    contain. Refits of the class since its introduction have kept a high demand
    for Excelsior-class starships in Starfleet, and allowed their continual use
    in an exploratory, border patrol, and even combat roles.</p>

        <p>Torpedoes may be fired in a salvo: a volley of several torpedoes,

        elsewhere on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the Attack
        inflicts one additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was
        targeting a specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial
        hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This
        additional hit is resolved separately, and each hit against the target
        is reduced by Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes
        Breaches, individually</p>
