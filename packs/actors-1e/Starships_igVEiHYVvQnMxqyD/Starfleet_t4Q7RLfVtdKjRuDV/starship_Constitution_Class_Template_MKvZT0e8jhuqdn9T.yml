    <p><strong>Entered Service:</strong> 2243</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Constitution-class starships defined and
    helped continue to define Starfleet during the 23rd century and beyond. In
    2235 Starfleet decided that, to better expand and protect the Federation as
    a whole, a more rugged and multi-purpose exploration vessel was needed that
    was able to stand up to the increasing threat of conflict with the Klingon
    Empire. The design that resulted would be used in dozens of later classes of
    starships; a saucer-like primary hull that contained the bridge and the
    majority of weapon systems, a cylindrical secondary hull that housed the
    class&rsquo;s warp core, navigational deflector and shuttlebay, and
    connected to two warp nacelles held far away from the vessel on long
    struts.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong> As an exploratory vessel, the Constitution
    class needed the best computer systems available, and was designed to use
    the newly developed duotronic computer system created by Doctor Richard
    Daystrom in 2243. This breakthrough in computing technology allowed the
    computer of Constitution-class starships to develop a limited AI-like
    personality that sometimes became too self-aware and would argue or bicker
    with officers and crew instead of providing information and analysis. The
    computer system was able to handle the input from as many sensors as was
    typically seen on three starships of previous classes, giving
    Constitutionclass vessels sensor resolution and accuracy unable to be
    matched until the late 2290s. To aid in exploration, the design had a large
    shuttlebay with four class-F shuttlecraft, but in an emergency situation
    could host six. While the warp propulsion systems were not highly advanced,
    they were made to be rugged and easily repaired, with many vessels warp
    coils operating at high subspace field densities for 7&ndash;8 times the
    recommended time for replacement. This resilience allowed Constitution-class
    vessels to operate far above their rated safety limits, with U.S.S.
    Enterprise achieving brief speeds of warp 14.1 in 2268, a speed record that
    would hold until the 24th century. The warp reactor itself made highly
    efficient use of antimatter by cycling warp plasma through networked reactor
    cylinders housed behind main engineering. The class also had a powerful
    multiple reactor fusion impulse system that was noted to be able to keep the
    starship aloft even inside planetary atmospheres that the vessels were not
    designed to enter. Automation of critical systems were not possible with the
    technology of the time, and the Constitution class required over 400 crew
    members for operation, with two-person teams crewing each of the
    design&rsquo;s six phaser banks and four-person teams crewing each torpedo
    launcher. To save on the already high number of crew on board, these teams
    were made up of crew from the vessel&rsquo;s scientific teams that would not
    typically be needed during combat operations. The success of the class meant
    that as further refinements to warp technology and computer systems became
    available, Constitution-class starships were often the first in line for
    refitting at shipyards across the Federation. The introduction of the
    Excelsior class began the slow decline of Constitution-class vessels, as the
    ships&rsquo; newer spaceframes and larger size made them better suited for
    deep space exploration missions.</p>

        <p>Torpedoes may be fired in a salvo: a volley of several torpedoes,

        2 Threat to the pool, along with the 1 point of Threat for a torpedo
        attack, for a total of 3 Threat. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds +3 to

        elsewhere on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the Attack
        inflicts one additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was
        targeting a specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial
        hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This
        additional hit is resolved separately, and each hit against the target
        is reduced by Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes
        Breaches, individually</p>
