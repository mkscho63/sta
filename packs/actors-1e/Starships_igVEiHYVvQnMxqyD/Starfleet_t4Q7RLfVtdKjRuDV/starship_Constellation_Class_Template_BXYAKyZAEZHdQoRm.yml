    <p><strong>Entered Service:</strong> 2285</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Designed in the mid-2280s in response to
    increasing tensions between the Klingon Empire and the Federation, the
    Constellation class was originally intended for use as a perimeter patrol
    vessel and heavy interceptor. The design was not intended as a true warship,
    therefore, when the initial Khitomer Accords were signed in 2293, the
    class&rsquo; production wasn&rsquo;t ceased, but its assignments were
    changed from being an alert interceptor to an emergency response vessel used
    to deal with crises that could rapidly spiral out of control without
    Starfleet&rsquo;s intervention.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong> Until the deployment of the Constellation
    class, Starfleet had never commissioned a four-nacelle design for general
    use in the fleet. The intent for the potent combination of four warp
    nacelles and two separate impulse drive reactor arrays was to provide the
    craft with the ability to maintain high warp speeds by alternating the use
    of two nacelles at a time and then switching the active nacelles before the
    warp coils would overheat and normally require a starship to drop out of
    warp. While Constellation-class vessels were not the highest velocity craft
    at warp speeds, the maximum sustained cruising speed of the vessel was just
    over warp 8. All four nacelles could be used to increase warp acceleration
    or push the maximum velocity of the craft to over warp 9. At sublight
    speeds, the two impulse arrays would tax the class&rsquo;s structural
    integrity field by accelerating from full stop to full impulse in less than
    five seconds, often surprising non-Federation crews by what was known as the
    &lsquo;Constellation Sprint&rsquo;. Another tactic developed on U.S.S.
    Stargazer NCC-2893 by then Lieutenant Commander JeanLuc Picard became known
    as the &lsquo;Picard Maneuver&rsquo; where the starship would accelerate and
    jump into warp and then drop back out to nearly full stop so the starship
    appeared to be in two places at once. This agility and speed lent itself to
    its re-designation as an emergency response vehicle. In addition, the
    vessels three large shuttle/fighter bays located along the edges of the
    saucer were redesigned for use in regular planetary shuttles or cargo
    shuttles. This made the Constellation class ideal for delivering large
    quantities of emergency supplies to vast areas of a planet&rsquo;s surface,
    or transporting colonists to newly terraformed worlds. The usefulness of
    this design has been great enough that Starfleet has kept many of these
    vessels on active duty, continuing to use them as couriers and rapid
    response, refitting them with new developments in technology over its
    decades of service.</p>

        <p>Torpedoes may be fired in a salvo: a volley of several torpedoes,

        attack, for a total of 3 Threat. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds +3 to
        Threat instead of +1, but it increases the attack&rsquo;s damage by +1
        Challenge Die, and grants the Spread effect to the attack.</p>

        elsewhere on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the Attack
        inflicts one additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was
        targeting a specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial
        hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This
        additional hit is resolved separately, and each hit against the target
        is reduced by Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes
        Breaches, individually</p>

        improved field dynamics, better control of antimatter flow rates, or
        some other advancement that allows the ship to expend less energy when
