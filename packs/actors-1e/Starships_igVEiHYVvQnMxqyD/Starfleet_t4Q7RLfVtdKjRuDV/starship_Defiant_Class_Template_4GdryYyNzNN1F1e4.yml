    <p><strong>Entered Service:</strong> 2371</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The primary purpose of Starfleet is science
    and exploration, with military prowess not being a priority. With some
    notable exceptions made during the EarthRomulan War, Starfleet had little
    experience designing ships specifically made for warfare. The Defiant class
    began development a year before the Battle of Wolf 359, and the
    starship&rsquo;s development and production was made a priority after the
    disastrous encounter with the Borg. Initial testing of the prototype showed
    serious flaws and was mothballed, along with the entire design project. The
    development of this class halted until 2370 when the commanding officer of
    Deep Space 9 requested the prototype be assigned to his command to help with
    the increasing tensions between the Federation and the Dominion.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong> The prototype (U.S.S. Defiant NX-74205)
    differs significantly from production models of the class by having a
    Romulan cloaking device. The amount of power required by the starship makes
    the cloak less effective than if it was used on another starship of similar
    mass, and careful sensor sweeps are still able to detect Defiant at close
    range. These same power requirements resulted in the shelving of the design
    due to the extreme power draw required for its weapon systems. The weapon
    systems installed include four forward-mounted pulsed phaser cannons, three
    secondary type-10 phaser strips, and a total of six (four forward and two
    aft mounted) multi-purpose torpedo launchers able to fire both standard Mark
    IV photon torpedoes or the newly developed quantum torpedoes. The
    class&rsquo;s maximum warp speed with weapons charged is warp 7, but with
    weapons offline Defiant class vessels can achieve an impressive Warp 9.5
    from warp coils normally unable to produce such a steep subspace gradient.
    Power draw for propulsion is nearly identical at sublight speeds as the
    starship&rsquo;s structural integrity field struggles to handle maneuvers
    normally seen in single crew shuttles or fighters. All of the weapon systems
    and power generation come at the cost of crew comforts. The Defiant class is
    one of the smallest starships used by Starfleet in an active role with a
    standard crew size of 50. However, even with this small crew, all crew
    (except the captain) must share quarters and rely on a single mess hall for
    any recreation while on board. The interior space did allow the inclusion of
    a small shuttlebay that is primarily for use when the starship is assigned
    to reconnaissance duties, and landing struts to facilitate emergency
    planetary landings or for planetary reconnaissance.</p>

    <p>As of 2371 only a single Defiant-class starship is in service (the
    prototype Defiant), but the team at Deep Space 9 have overcome many of the
    prototype&rsquo;s flaws, and several additional Defiant-class starships are
    under construction.</p>

        <p><strong>Area:</strong> The attack affects a wider area, and can
        affect several targets at once. The attack automatically affects any
        vessel or damageable object within Contact of the initial target, and
        then one additional target within Close range of the initial target for
        each Effect rolled, starting with the next closest (as determined by the
        GM). If one or more Complications is rolled when using an Area attack,
        the GM may choose to use Complications to have an allied vessel or
        neutral bystander in the area affected by the attack. A target cannot be
        hit if it would have been more difficult to hit than the initial
        target.</p>

        <p>Quantum torpedoes are a recent development by the Federation, though
        others have made similar developments. They&rsquo;re more powerful than
        photon torpedoes, though the way they achieve this is classified. They
        have a base Damage of 4 Challenge Dice Vicious 1, with the Calibration
        and High-Yield Qualities.</p>

        <p>Torpedoes may be fired in a salvo: a volley of several torpedoes,
        intended to have a much greater effect. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds
        2 Threat to the pool, along with the 1 point of Threat for a torpedo
        attack, for a total of 3 Threat. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds +3 to
        Threat instead of +1, but it increases the attack&rsquo;s damage by +1
        Challenge Die, and grants the Spread effect to the attack.</p>

        <p><strong>Calibration:</strong> The weapon requires careful calibration
        before firing. The weapon cannot be used to attack unless a <em>Prepare
        </em>Minor Action is performed during the same Turn.</p>

        <p><strong>High-Yield:</strong> The weapon inflicts massive damage to
        enemy vessels; if the Attack inflicts one or more Breaches to a system,
        it inflicts one additional Breach.</p>

        <p><strong>Spread: </strong>The Attack inflicts additional damage
        elsewhere on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the Attack
        inflicts one additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was
        targeting a specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial
        hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This
        additional hit is resolved separately, and each hit against the target
        is reduced by Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes
        Breaches, individually.</p>

        <p>The tactical officer engages a tractor beam at a nearby object or
        vessel. This requires a <strong>Control + Security</strong> Task,
        assisted by the ship&rsquo;s <strong>Structure + Security</strong> with
        a Difficulty of 2, and can only be directed at a target within Close
        range. If successful, the target vessel is immobilized and cannot move
        unless it can break free, using their shield modulations, the raw power
        of their engines, or disabling the tractor beam emitter (a Task in its
        own right), with a Difficulty of 2.</p>
