  traits: Small Craft
  notes: >-
    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> The Next Generation only</p>

    <p>These larger auxiliary craft are used for independent operations from
    larger starships and starbases. They are capable of warp 5, contain a small
    transporter and a replicator, and are fitted with phaser arrays for defense.
    A modular construction allows them to be converted to serve different
    purposes.</p>

        many cultures, including the Klingons, the Cardassians, and the
        Federation. They have a base Damage of 3 Challenge Dice, with the
        High-Yield Quality.</p>

        <p>Torpedoes may be fired in a salvo: a volley of several torpedoes,
        intended to have a much greater effect. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds
        2 Threat to the pool, along with the 1 point of Threat for a torpedo
        attack, for a total of 3 Threat. Firing a salvo of torpedoes adds +3 to
        Threat instead of +1, but it increases the attack&rsquo;s damage by +1
        Challenge Die, and grants the Spread effect to the attack.</p>

        <p><strong>High-Yield:</strong> The weapon inflicts massive damage to
        enemy vessels; if the Attack inflicts one or more Breaches to a system,
        it inflicts one additional Breach.</p>

        <p><strong>Spread:</strong> The Attack inflicts additional damage
        elsewhere on the target. If one or more Effects is rolled, the Attack
        inflicts one additional hit to a random system (even if the Attack was
        targeting a specific system), which deals half the damage of the initial
        hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This
        additional hit is resolved separately, and each hit against the target
        is reduced by Resistance, reduces Shields, and potentially causes
        Breaches, individually</p>
