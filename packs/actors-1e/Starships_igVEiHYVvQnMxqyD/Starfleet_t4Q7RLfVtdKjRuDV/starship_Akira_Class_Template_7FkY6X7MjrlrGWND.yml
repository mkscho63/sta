    <p><strong>Entered Service:</strong> 2368</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> During the aftermath of the Battle of Wolf 359
    in 2367, Starfleet saw the need for a more heavily armed vessel capable of
    patrolling and protecting large volumes of territory against possible Borg
    incursions, while continuing the primary mission of all Starfleet vessels,
    exploring the unknown. The Advanced Starship Design Bureau at the Antares
    Fleet Yards took a concept design, never planned for service, and turned it
    into the U.S.S. Akira in 2368; trial runs were so successful that Starfleet
    Command immediately ordered full-scale production of the Akira class to
    begin.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong> Unlike most vessels of its mass,
    Akira-class starships do not have a separate engineering hull, rather the
    vessel is designed to be as compact as possible to aid in maintaining a
    strong defensive shield strength over its entire surface area. Other
    defensive measures included raised pontoon-like structures on either side of
    the saucer that contained secondary shield generators to help protect vital
    command and control systems as well as highly sensitive sensor networks for
    planetary survey and stellar cartography missions that could double as
    back-up targeting systems for the vessel&rsquo;s weaponry. The Akira class
    was also designed with extensive shuttlebays and attached support and
    maintenance facilities capable of manufacturing shuttles from scratch with
    the right raw materials. Capable of deploying shuttles of any size,
    fighters, and even Danube class runabouts, the Akira class is superb at
    space supremacy in combat roles and extensive stellar system survey in
    peacetime. If the mission assignment requires it, the shuttle recovery and
    maintenance systems are replaceable with cargo compartments and extra bulk
    transporter systems or even extra personnel quarters and life support
    systems to allow the craft to perform rescue and recovery operations. The
    torpedo pod mounted between the two pontoons aft of the hull isn&rsquo;t as
    easily replaceable as the shuttlebays in the main hull due to the complex
    power feeds and targeting system relays that feed up the connecting pylons
    to the pod. This hasn&rsquo;t stopped ASDB from working on ideas that
    include making sub-classes of the vessel that would replace the weapons
    systems with a subspace scanning array equal in size and resolution to ones
    typically seen in fixed installations. The torpedo pod itself is a unique
    design in Starfleet vessels, with a series of tubes in a line capable of a
    nearly continuous barrage as the system staggers the fire of each tube. Each
    of the standard tubes can be loaded with a store of subspace buoys or sensor
    probes, but the quantum torpedo systems standard on each vessel are
    dedicated systems and unable to launch alternate munitions.</p>

        <p>The vessel&rsquo;s hull plating has an additional ablative layer that
        disintegrates slowly under extreme temperatures, such as those caused by
        energy weapons and torpedo blasts, dissipating the energy, and
        protecting the ship. This plating is replaced periodically. The
        ship&rsquo;s Resistance is increased by 2.</p>

        <p>The vessel&rsquo;s torpedo launchers have been redesigned to allow
        the ship to fire multiple torpedoes much more quickly and accurately.
        Whenever the crew add 3 to Threat to fire a torpedo salvo, they may
        re-roll a single d20 on the attack, and any number of Challenge Dice on
        the damage roll.</p>

        <p>Arrays are long strips of linked emitters that share a power feed,
        allowing the ship to fire from any point along the strip. This allows
        the ship to fire in multiple directions at once, or to adjust and fire
        on moving targets repeatedly in quick succession. Arrays have a Range
        category of Medium. Further, when declaring the target of an attack with
        an Array, the attacking character may choose to grant one of the Area or
        Spread effects to the attack.</p>

        <p><strong>Area:</strong> The attack affects a wider area, and can
        affect several targets at once. The attack automatically affects any
        vessel or damageable object within Contact of the initial target, and
        then one additional target within Close range of the initial target for
        each Effect rolled, starting with the next closest (as determined by the
        GM). If one or more Complications is rolled when using an Area attack,
        the GM may choose to use Complications to have an allied vessel or
        neutral bystander in the area affected by the attack. A target cannot be
        hit if it would have been more difficult to hit than the initial
        target.</p>

        <p><strong>Versatile 2:</strong> The attack gains 2 points of bonus
        Momentum if successful.</p>
