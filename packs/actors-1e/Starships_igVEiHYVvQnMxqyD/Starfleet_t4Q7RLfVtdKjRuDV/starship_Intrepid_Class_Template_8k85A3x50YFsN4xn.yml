    <p><strong>Entered Service:</strong> 2371</p>

    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> By the mid-2360s the success and failures of
    the Galaxy class were clear to Starfleet. Its large size and crew along with
    increasing use as a diplomatic vessel rather than exploratory craft made
    engineers in Starfleet begin designing the next great explorer, the Intrepid
    class. This first of its class was launched in 2371 to great fanfare and was
    quickly seen by the Federation Science Council as a valuable resource. It is
    small compared to the Galaxy class, more closely resembling a Constitution
    class, but contains the best technology available to the Federation.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong> The sleek curves of the Intrepid class
    weren&rsquo;t just a stylistic choice, they assisted the variable geometry
    warp nacelles in producing a tight warp field over the starship with a steep
    and stable field gradient in even turbulent space-time conditions, giving
    these vessels both an impressive warp acceleration and stability. These
    features, along with the vessels primary class-9 warp drive and its
    secondary warp assembly allowed the class an impressive top speed of warp
    9.975. While its sustained warp speeds are considerably slower, they are
    still fast enough to allow Starfleet to hail the design as its new
    deep-space explorer. To aid in this role, Intrepid-class vessels are also
    equipped with the best technology in the Federation, including the newest
    generation of multi-spectral subspace sensors linked into the most powerful
    shipboard computer yet in service in Starfleet. This computing power is
    possible through a breakthrough in the use of bio-neural circuitry, allowing
    the vessels&rsquo; computer to form information connections in a faster and
    more natural way, giving the main computer the unique ability to adapt to
    new and confusing situations as well as improvise solutions much like
    sentient life-forms. This increased computer power allows the Intrepid class
    more automation than many Starfleet vessels, keeping the typical crew
    rosters down to between 130&ndash;150 officers and crew. As it&rsquo;s a
    deep-space exploratory vessel, all Intrepid-class starships have an
    impressive amount of tactical systems as standard, the reasoning being that
    it would be operating far from any other allied starships and may need to
    defend itself against multiple attackers. The Intrepid class has thirteen
    type-10 phaser strips, an additional four type 8 phaser emitters, and five
    torpedo launchers (two forward, two aft, and one ventral launcher that is
    typically only loaded with probes). To further planetary exploration, all
    Intrepid-class vessels are assigned at least four type-6 or type-8
    shuttlecraft in addition to the class-specific aeroshuttle that is located
    on the ventral side of the primary hull. For crew recreation, new high
    resolution holo-emitters and integrated replicator systems made holodecks
    power efficient and able to create permanent matter in the simulation to
    prevent continual holo-emitter use and degradation. These same holo-emitters
    are also installed in the sickbay, allowing the new Emergency Medical
    Hologram system (EMH) to assist medical personnel when they require it.</p>

        <p>Arrays are long strips of linked emitters that share a power feed,
        allowing the ship to fire from any point along the strip. This allows
        the ship to fire in multiple directions at once, or to adjust and fire

        category of Medium. Further, when declaring the target of an attack with
        an Array, the attacking character may choose to grant one of the Area or
        Spread effects to the attack.</p>

        <p><strong>Area:</strong> The attack affects a wider area, and can
        affect several targets at once. The attack automatically affects any
        vessel or damageable object within Contact of the initial target, and
        then one additional target within Close range of the initial target for
        each Effect rolled, starting with the next closest (as determined by the
        GM). If one or more Complications is rolled when using an Area attack,
        the GM may choose to use Complications to have an allied vessel or
        neutral bystander in the area affected by the attack. A target cannot be
        hit if it would have been more difficult to hit than the initial
        target.</p>

        <p><strong>Spread:</strong> The Attack inflicts additional damage

        hit, rounding up, +1 for every Effect rolled after the first. This
