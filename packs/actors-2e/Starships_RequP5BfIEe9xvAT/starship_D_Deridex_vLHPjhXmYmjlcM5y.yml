    <p>OVERVIEW: The Romulan Empire kept to itself through the first half of the
    24th century, continually expanding its borders away from the Federation.
    Using ideas gleaned from the Klingon Empire&rsquo;s trade of D7s in the late
    2260s and further native technological advances, the Empire produced the
    D&rsquo;Deridex class warbird beginning in 2350. The D&rsquo;Deridex was
    successful enough that the Empire continued to produce it until the
    shipyards capable of building them were destroyed in the Romulan
    supernova.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: The massive spaceframe utilizes two different types of warp
    coil design. At each side standard warp nacelles and coils produce the warp
    field, but monopolar subspace field generators installed across the dorsal
    and ventral &lsquo;wings&rsquo; of the vessel provide stability while at
    high warp velocities. This class is the first vessel of its size to be
    powered by an artificial quantum singularity, essentially a subspace
    compressed mass replicating a black hole on a small scale. The immense
    amount of power this can produce is augmented by standard fusion reactors
    and allows the ship to move at speeds of warp 9.6, and warp 6 even while
    under cloak.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Refits leading into the Dominion War saw
    improvements to weapon and sensor systems. Plans for improving the quantum
    singularity reactor were begun in the 2380s but halted with the destruction
    of the Romulan star system.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Battlecruiser, Multirole Explorer,
    Espionage/Intelligence, Tactical Operations, Technical Testbed.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: D&rsquo;Deridex names include famous starship
    commanders from Romulan history and important Imperial worlds.</p>

        <p><br>Activating the device is a major action which requires Reserve

        Difficulty of 2, assisted by the ship&rsquo;s Engines + Security. This
        is operated from the ship&rsquo;s Tactical position. If successful, the
        vessel gains the Cloaked trait. While cloaked, the vessel cannot attempt
        any attacks, nor can it be the target of an attack unless the attacker
        has found some way of detecting the cloaked vessel. While cloaked, a
        vessel&rsquo;s shields are down. Deactivating the cloaking device
        requires a minor action.</p>
