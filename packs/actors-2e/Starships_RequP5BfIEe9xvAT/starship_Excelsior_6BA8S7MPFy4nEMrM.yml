    <p>OVERVIEW: What was originally intended as a testbed for the highly
    experimental &ldquo;transwarp&rdquo; propulsion system, the &ldquo;Great
    Experiment&rdquo; was seen as a disaster after the complete failure of
    Excelsior&rsquo;s propulsion systems in 2285. After a total redesign was
    performed on nearly all ship&rsquo;s systems, the transwarp propulsion was
    replaced with standard warp propulsion. The versatile Excelsior spaceframe
    became a standard sight across the Federation and beyond, and it continued
    to be manufactured into the 2390s.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: Originally intended for the large transwarp coils, the
    spaceframe&rsquo;s nacelles provided ample room for extra standard coils
    that allowed the class to have some of the highest sustained warp speeds for
    a ship of its size. Stemming from the initial high-power needs for the
    transwarp system, the spaceframe had nearly double the amount of fusion
    reactors required for secondary power systems and the impulse drive. These
    same reactors provide extra power to the ship&rsquo;s defensive shielding.
    The Excelsior also had two dedicated shuttlebays, the main shuttlebay and a
    lower bay on the underside of the secondary hull used for cargo transport
    and storage.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: A single variant built at San Francisco Shipyards
    spread across the Federation. While visually similar to the standard
    spaceframe, the saucer section of the vessel contained double the number of
    fusion reactors and added two additional impulse drive units. The incredible
    sublight acceleration this provided meant the secondary hull had two
    &nbsp;extensions built to contain improvements to the inertial
    dampeners.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Strategic and Diplomatic Operations,
    Multirole Explorer, Technical Testbed.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Excelsior-class vessels take names from concepts of
    exploration, achievement, and great leaders from across the Federation; many
    are also named after famous ships from previous generations. Forrest,
    Archer, and Victory are all examples.</p>
