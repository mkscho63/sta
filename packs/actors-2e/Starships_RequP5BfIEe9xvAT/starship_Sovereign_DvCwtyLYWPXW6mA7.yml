    <p>OVERVIEW: The Sovereign class began development in 2368 after Starfleet
    Command felt that starships probing deep space would need to be better
    equipped to handle hostile and more technologically advanced races such as
    the Borg. The first vessels were launched in the months before the conflict
    with the Klingon Empire began. After the Dominion War, these vessels became
    a part of Starfleet&rsquo;s renewed push to return to exploration and
    research.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: The Sovereign class utilizes variable geometry warp drive,
    able to replicate the same qualities of the Intrepid class&rsquo;s variable
    pitch warp nacelles without the adjustable pylons. The Sovereign class has
    extensive laboratories, sensor systems, and subspace transmitters that make
    it an excellent deep-space explorer. The design includes significant
    firepower, including a dedicated quantum torpedo launcher and multiple
    Type-10a phaser strips.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: One major variant was designed and constructed at
    the Andorian Imperial Ship Yards, named Sheetar, NCC-73850. The Andorian
    engineers who designed her wanted to show a ship of exploration could also
    double as a combat vessel when needed.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Strategic and Diplomatic Operations,
    Scientific and Survey Operations, Multirole Explorer. Sovereign-class
    starships are cutting-edge spaceframes capable of being outfitted for almost
    any kind of mission Starfleet can imagine.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Sovereign-class vessels are often named after famous
    ships from Federation history. Farragut, Wasp, and Shran are all
    examples.</p>
