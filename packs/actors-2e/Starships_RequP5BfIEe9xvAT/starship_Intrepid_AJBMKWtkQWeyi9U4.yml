    <p>OVERVIEW: Containing the best technology of the early 2370s and evolved
    from the Nova class&rsquo;s design, the Intrepid class was a symbol of the
    Federation Science Council&rsquo;s intent to have Starfleet return to its
    goals of exploration and science. The Dominion War reduced the number of
    hulls constructed, but the end of the war&mdash;and the return of U.S.S.
    Voyager in 2378&mdash;meant renewed passion for this spaceframe. Many
    Intrepid-class vessels remain in active service well into the 25th
    century.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: The Intrepid class was designed around being as efficient
    in its warp field geometry as possible, while also allowing for rapid
    transit of turbulent space-time. The vessel also has variable geometry warp
    nacelles that allow fine adjustment to the warp field, improving warp
    stability, allowing high sustained warp speeds, and granting an impressive
    maximum emergency speed of warp 9.975. Intrepid-class vessels were the first
    to have bioneural computer components installed to augment the advanced
    isolinear computer core. These bioneural systems allowed the ship to
    &ldquo;learn&rdquo; as it formed data connections in a more efficient way
    than standard isolinear indexing.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Refits for the Intrepid class focused on improving
    and expanding the sensor platforms.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Pathfinder and Reconnaissance Operations,
    Scientific and Survey Operations, Technical Testbed.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Intrepid-class vessels take names from mythology and
    space exploration across the Federation. Pathfinder, Odysseus, and
    Bellerophon are some examples.</p>

        <p><br>The ship has one additional supporting character, an Emergency
        Medical Hologram (EMH), using the attributes, departments, and so forth

        <p>SUBSEQUENT EMH MODELS<br>For every three years after 2371, the
        current model of EMH is replaced by a newer model (Mark II in 2374,

        <li>MARK II: +1 Presence</li>
