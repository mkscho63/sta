    <p>OVERVIEW: As the Federation spread in the 2350s, Starfleet saw a lack of
    vessels able to respond to needs of all kinds inside the borders. Starfleet
    asked member worlds to design and build their own starship class to be able
    to respond to issues they felt were pressing to their own interests. Earth
    presented the California class, which would go on to influence the design of
    the Galaxy class. California-class vessels were seen as dependable
    workhorses.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: California-class vessels included a dedicated section to
    provide the growing number of Cetaceans graduating from Starfleet Academy a
    more natural environment in which to work and live. These vessels also
    included multiple shuttlebays allowing Cetacean and humanoid crew access to
    small craft. California-class vessels contained most of their livable volume
    in their primary saucer-like hull. The secondary hull contained main
    engineering, primary antimatter storage, and the main deflector array. This
    entire section could be ejected in an emergency and limited warp propulsion
    could be maintained by the ship&rsquo;s fusion reactors.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Most refits centered on improving the power output
    of the warp reactor or improving power output from the phaser arrays.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Logistical/Quartermaster, Colony Support,
    Reserve Fleet, Scientific and Survey Operations, Crisis and Emergency
    Response. California-class ships are support vessels, intended to perform
    the unglamorous but necessary work that keeps the Federation running, and
    their livery often reflects their mission profile.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: California-class vessels are named after locations
    found within the North American state of California. Burbank, Fresno, and
    West Covina are examples.</p>
