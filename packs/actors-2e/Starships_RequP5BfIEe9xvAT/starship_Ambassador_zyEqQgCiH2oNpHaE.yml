    <p>OVERVIEW: Starfleet had been relying on Excelsior-class and the few
    Constitution-class starships still in service to continue its aims of
    discovery, but even with the planned refits of those spaceframes, they still
    required visits to logistical hubs every five years as systems wore down.
    Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards began to develop a new deep-space exploration
    cruiser that would address these concerns. The Ambassador class was
    developed and launched, and many of the engineering techniques, design
    ideas, and technologies created would be refined and become the basis for
    the Galaxy class.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: The Ambassador class was designed in a similar way to
    previous Starfleet cruisers, with a saucer-shaped primary hull and a
    cylindrical secondary engineering hull. The most obvious difference is the
    then-unique warp nacelles containing high-efficiency warp coils with
    directional subspace buffers. The Ambassador class was wildly successful,
    but also a victim of its own innovation. Research and development continued
    on the ground-breaking systems, improving them faster than they could be
    installed, and it became apparent the Ambassador class wasn&rsquo;t able to
    keep up with technological development. Production was halted on further
    spaceframes, replacing newer construction with the Galaxy class beginning in
    the 2360s.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Two separate refit programs were used. The
    Enterprise program improved the vessel&rsquo;s subspace communication and
    sensor platforms. The Pollux program was dedicated to improving the
    vessel&rsquo;s weapon systems and warp drive.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Multirole Explorer, Scientific and Survey
    Operations, Strategic and Diplomatic Operations.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Ambassador-class vessels are often named after
    important ambassadors and peacemakers, great battles and ships of the past,
    or hopeful ideas for the future. T&rsquo;Pau, Merrimack, and Progress are
    all examples. The U.S.S. Ambassador had a registry of NX/NCC-10521, and
    subsequent vessels have higher registries.</p>
