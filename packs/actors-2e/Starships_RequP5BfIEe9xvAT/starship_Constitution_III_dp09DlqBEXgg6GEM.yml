    <p>OVERVIEW: The first Constitution III-class ships entered service in 2396,
    after a short development period. Many of the earliest vessels of the class
    had their construction accelerated by repurposing many components from
    vessels which had suffered catastrophic damage or were otherwise being
    decommissioned. The overall design of the Constitution III-class, however,
    owes more to a different legacy. Often referred to as the Neo-Constitution,
    the design resembles the Constitution-class ships of the 23rd century,
    particularly the refit (or Constitution II) design which entered service in
    2270.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: Constitution III-class ships are built to function as
    versatile exploratory craft, able to fulfil a wide range of mission
    objectives. The design and construction coincided with new developments in
    propulsion technology, which were integrated into the project development;
    the result is a class with the highest Impulse power-to-geometry ratio in
    the fleet, and a top speed of warp 9.99. This makes it ideal for rapidly
    responding to emergencies and changing circumstances in densely populated
    regions.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: The class is often regarded more as a refit project
    than a dedicated class, blurring the line between creating a new ship and
    rebuilding an existing one.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Multirole Explorer, Strategic and Diplomatic
    Operations, Crisis and Emergency Response</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Constitution III-class vessels are mostly named after
    previous Starfleet vessels, often the ones which contributed components to
    the new design, such as the Titan.</p>
