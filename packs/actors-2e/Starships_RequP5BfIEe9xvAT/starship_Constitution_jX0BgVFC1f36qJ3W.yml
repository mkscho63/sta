    <p>OVERVIEW: The symbol of Starfleet in the mid-to-late 23rd century, the
    Constitution class became legendary due to its five-year missions that
    expanded the Federation&rsquo;s borders and its scientific knowledge. The
    Constitution class became the testbed of new technologies in the early 2270s
    developed out of the five-year missions and lessons learned from the brief
    war with the Klingon Empire. The spaceframe continued in service until the
    mid-24th century.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: The Constitution class defined what a starship should be
    able to accomplish when on extended deep-space exploration assignments. The
    spaceframe had accommodations for over 400 crew members, enough to provide
    redundancy for crew positions ranging from astrocartographers to
    xenobiologists, allowing for crew losses typical on five-year missions. The
    ship had a spacious shuttlebay and cargo area at the aft of the secondary
    hull that allowed the class to move large amounts of supplies or personnel
    even without the use of transporters.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Vessels produced by other founding members of the
    Federation tended to focus on their own fleets&rsquo; specialties.
    Andorian-built vessels had larger fusion reactors and Tellarite-built
    vessels were sought after for their powerful duotronic computer networks.
    Vulcan-produced vessels focused on improving sensors and communications.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Multirole Explorer, Strategic and Diplomatic
    Operations, Flagship, Scientific and Survey Operations.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Constitution-class vessels are often named after
    famous Earth navy vessels and pre-warp spacecraft. Registry numbers range
    between 1700 and 1799, though there are exceptions.</p>
