    <p>OVERVIEW: Designed and developed by Zefram Cochrane&rsquo;s Warp Five
    Project and the joint Starfleet/United Earth Space Probe Agency NX Project,
    the NX class was groundbreaking in nearly every way. Its large saucer-like
    hull was different from earlier spherical or cylindrical hulls of most UESPA
    vessels. The ship also had two long warp nacelles connected to trailing
    pylons, isolating the experimental warp coils from the rest of the ship.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: At the time of its launch, the NX class was the fastest
    starship in service to United Earth. The spaceframe was capable of cruising
    at warp 4.5 and could produce emergency speeds of warp 5.2 in short bursts.
    In an era before energy shielding, the spaceframe boasted an impressive
    amount of polarized hull-plating that helped protect the inner hull and
    inhabited areas. The spaceframe had the capability of launching two
    shuttlepods, with a third held in reserve.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: NX-class vessels were used during the decade prior
    to the Earth-Romulan War and rarely afterward. The largest refit was
    conducted during the war, adding a secondary hull with an improved warp core
    and additional weapon systems.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Multirole Explorer, Technical Testbed.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: NX-class vessels utilize names from famous Earth
    ships&mdash;both maritime vessels and early spacecraft&mdash;often names
    with long legacies. NX-class vessels have registries that begin with NX, and
    are numbered sequentially.</p>
