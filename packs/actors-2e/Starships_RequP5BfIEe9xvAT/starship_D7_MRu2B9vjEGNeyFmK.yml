    <p>OVERVIEW: The Klingon fleets of the mid-23rd century were a scattered
    collection of individual House fleets up until the late 2250s. After the
    ascension of Chancellor L&rsquo;Rell of House Mo&rsquo;Kai, the Klingon
    Empire began a concerted fleet reconstruction effort, consolidating military
    power with the Klingon Defense Force. Central to this was a ship design
    presented by the Chancellor as a new symbol of Klingon unity: this design
    would become known as the D7 Battlecruiser, and it would remain as the
    cornerstone of Klingon military might in space for decades to come.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: The D7 continues the long design traditions of the KDF by
    having a command pod at the end of a long detachable boom that connects to
    the engineering hull. With the primary purpose of the D7 being war, the
    weapon systems on board had top priority for the use of internal volume. Two
    separate photon torpedo launchers provide the spaceframe&rsquo;s primary
    destructive capabilities.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Refits for the D7, and its successor the
    K&rsquo;t&rsquo;inga-class depended greatly on if it was in service to the
    KDF or a Great House. One major development was the reintroduction of
    cloaking to the fleet in 2269.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Battlecruiser, Strategic and Diplomatic
    Operations, Reserve Fleet.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Klingon vessels have little in the way of standard
    naming conventions. Each House has its own traditions, as does the KDF.</p>
