    <p>OVERVIEW: By the mid-24th century, the Ferengi Alliance had expanded
    across multiple sectors. The vast range of societies and species it
    encountered meant the Alliance, while heavily centralized in the Ferenginar
    system, had to maintain the ever-growing trade lanes as well as ensure the
    markets would stay linked to the homeworld, through free trade or by force.
    The Ferengi Congress of Economic Advisors levied a tax on all non-Ferengi
    economic activity to begin construction of the D’Kora-class marauder.
    Ferenginar had no active force like Starfleet, but the Congress would
    provide a letter of marque to any free trader willing to captain and crew a
    vessel for the good of the Alliance. D’Kora marauders quickly became a
    symbol of the Ferengi Alliance across the Alpha and Beta Quadrants, feared
    for their weaponry and the economic exploitation that would occur in their
    presence.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: The D’Kora needed a large amount of its internal volume as
    mission adaptable space, but the vast majority of commanding officers used
    this space as cargo storage. The standard production vessel included a
    unique system tied to the vessel’s warp coils. If these warp coils were
    purposely put out of alignment and charged, the plasma could be discharge as
    a powerful electromagnetic pulse, disrupting a hostile ship’s systems and
    defensive shielding, and, in a best case, render the other ship powerless
    and available for acquisition.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: The Ferengi Alliance stayed out of the Dominion War
    except for arms sales to both sides. Trading in war zones can be hazardous
    to the safety of one’s ship, thus the Alliance put forth a rare regulation
    to improve the marauder’s shielding, structural integrity fields, and other
    safety equipment.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Espionage/Intelligence, Pathfinder and
    Reconnaissance, Tactical Operations, Technical Testbed.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: D’Kora-class maruaders take&nbsp;names from their
    commanding officers or their loved ones, or the limited liability companies
    they are owned by.</p>
