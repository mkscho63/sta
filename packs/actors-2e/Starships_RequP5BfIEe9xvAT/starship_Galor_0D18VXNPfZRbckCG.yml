    <p>OVERVIEW: Designed and built during the middle of the long
    Federation-Cardassian War of the mid-24th century, the Galor-class cruiser
    was meant to be the answer to the effective Starfleet Ambassador- and
    Excelsior-class vessels common along the frontier. Sacrifices in the design
    had to be made as the Union lacked the same shipbuilding facilities as the
    Federation. These cruisers were rarely seen alone, and often in small
    squadrons of three to five. Through two wars, the Galor and her sister
    classes were the backbone of the Cardassian Central Command.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: Simplicity, ease of maintenance and construction, and
    having as small of a logistics need as possible were all important when the
    Galor was designed. These cruisers do not have a torpedo system installed,
    as Central Command felt wasting antimatter on weapons would limit the number
    of starships they could produce. Instead, this class utilized two separate
    energy weapon systems: phaser arrays spread across the outer hull and a
    heavy forward mounted disruptor emitter.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Central Command issued orders after the class came
    into service to improve the weapon systems with any captured technology.
    During the Dominion War, this focus changed to improvements to the outer
    hull and warp propulsion.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Espionage/Intelligence, Pathfinder and
    Reconnaissance, Patrol, Reserve Fleet, Tactical Operations, Technical
    Testbed.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Galor class cruisers take their names from famous war
    leaders of Cardassia&rsquo;s past, important cities on Cardassian Prime, and
    war heroes.</p>
