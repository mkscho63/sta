    <p>OVERVIEW: Before K&rsquo;tinga discovered the Romulan treachery with
    trading faulty cloaking devices, the engineers in the KDF began designing a
    starship capable of using the faulty cloaking device as is. It was
    determined that a bird-of-prey design similar to the Vo&rsquo;n&rsquo;talk
    class would provide the ideal form for the new vessel, and the first
    B&rsquo;rel launched in 2280.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: The forward command pod contains the bridge and large
    captain&rsquo;s quarters that contained an area dedicated to either a
    targ-pit or gagh breeding tub so the commanding officer may always have
    fresh food. The majority of the small crew lived and worked in the
    engineering hull. The power generated from the multistage fusion reactors
    give the class an impressive sublight acceleration and a top warp velocity
    of 9.9 for a short duration. While the cloak is active, the drain on power
    is extreme, and cruising warp velocities are reduced to warp 5.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Engineers continued to improve the cloaking devices
    through the 23rd and early 24th centuries, allowing for greater warp speeds
    while cloaked. Improvements to weapons systems and targeting arrays were
    also prioritized.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Crisis and Emergency Response, Patrol,
    Tactical Operations.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Klingon vessels have little in the way of standard
    naming conventions. Each House has its own traditions, as does the KDF.</p>
