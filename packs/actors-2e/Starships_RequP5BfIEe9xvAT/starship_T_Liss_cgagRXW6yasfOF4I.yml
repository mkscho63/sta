    <p>OVERVIEW: For the hundred years since the Earth-Romulan War, the Empire
    had continued to improve its weapon systems and ship building capabilities.
    Covert acquisition of duotronic technology from the Federation meant a new
    generation of warbirds would need to be built. The Romulan Senate gave
    approval to the Imperial Navy&rsquo;s design that harkened back to the older
    birds-of-prey used against the Coalition of Worlds, with the first leaving
    Romulus orbit in late 2265, and first being seen by the Federation in 2266.
    The T&rsquo;Liss class would continue to be manufactured by the Empire into
    the early 24th century.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: T&rsquo;Liss class birds of prey are larger vessels than
    their older counterparts. Four decks and crewed by 170, the vessel is both
    compact and uses much of its habitable space efficiently through shared
    bunks in officer and enlisted quarters. This highly compact habitable space
    is needed as the powerful plasma torpedo system takes up nearly half the
    internal volume of the vessel, with a significant percentage of the
    remaining space taken by the ship&rsquo;s paired matter/antimatter warp
    cores and dual fusion reactors. The ship also used a small and effective
    cloaking device that was tied into the vessel&rsquo;s shield emitters to
    reduce power demands.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Romulan engineers continually improved the power
    output of their matter/antimatter reactors and reduced the power needs of
    the plasma torpedo system to the point that only a single reactor was
    needed.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Espionage/Intelligence, Pathfinder and
    Reconnaissance, Tactical Operations, Technical Testbed.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: T&rsquo;Liss warbirds are named after powerful
    senators the navy wished to gain favour with, and concepts of martial
    prowess.</p>

        <p>REQUIREMENT: Klingon or Romulan ship, or gamemaster&rsquo;s
        discretion</p>

        <p><br>Activating the device is a major action which requires Reserve
        Power, and which requires a Control +&nbsp;Engineering task with a
        Difficulty of 2, assisted by the ship&rsquo;s Engines + Security. This
        is operated from the ship&rsquo;s Tactical position. If successful, the
        vessel gains the Cloaked trait. While cloaked, the vessel cannot attempt
        any attacks, nor can it be the target of an attack unless the attacker
        has found some way of detecting the cloaked vessel. While cloaked, a
        vessel&rsquo;s shields are down. Deactivating the cloaking device
        requires a minor action.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>PROTOTYPE: The cloaking device employed on this&nbsp;vessel has some
        notable limitations. The vessel cannot travel at warp while cloaked, and
        the difficulty of the task roll to activate the cloak increases to
        3.</p>
