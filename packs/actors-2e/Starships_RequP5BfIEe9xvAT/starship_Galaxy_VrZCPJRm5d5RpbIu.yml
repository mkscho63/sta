    <p>OVERVIEW: The Galaxy class was designed to surpass any exploration and
    science vessel yet developed by Starfleet. This spaceframe also represented
    a new philosophy for crew mental well-being on long duration assignments, as
    Starfleet provided facilities for civilian dependents and volunteers. The
    concept centered on not separating families from loved ones for years at a
    time, and the morale on Galaxy-class vessels was correspondingly higher.</p>

    <p>CAPABILITIES: As one of the largest spaceframes manufactured by
    Starfleet, the interior volume of was often not fully allocated by the time
    it began its first mission assignment. This modular customization meant
    these vessels often had civilian specialists on board for even the most
    obscure research paths. As the Galaxy class was meant to probe far away from
    Federation space, the vessel had both the most powerful warp core of its day
    and the most advanced warp coils, allowing even a ship of its size to
    maintain a cruising warp velocity of 6 and a maximum velocity of warp 9.8.
    Galaxy class vessels were also the first that could separate and re-dock
    their primary hull to the engineering hull without the assistance of a
    drydock or support vessels. This meant Galaxy-class vessels could split
    their focus efficiently, or put civilians and dependents out of harm&rsquo;s
    way in hostile situations.</p>

    <p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: During the Dominion War, Galaxy-class vessels
    nearing completion were repurposed as command-and-control vessels for rear
    admirals to use in fleet actions.</p>

    <p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Strategic and Diplomatic Operations,
    Scientific and Survey Operations, Multirole Explorer.</p>

    <p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Galaxy-class vessels take their names from many
    different cultures across the Federation. Most are associated with
    exploration and scientific discovery. Odyssey, Hanson, and Surok are
    examples. The U.S.S. Galaxy was NX/NCC-70637, and all vessels of the class
    have registries higher than this, barring the Enterprise, which used its own
    legacy number.</p>

        <p>The ship is designed so the saucer section can be separated from the
        engineering section to operate as two distinct ships. Each section has
        the same systems, talents, and weapons, but their Scale is 1 lower than
        that of the original vessel (recalculate anything derived from Scale).
        Further, if the ship suffered any breaches prior to separating, ongoing
        effects of those breaches apply equally to both sections. The saucer
        section, which usually contains the crew quarters and recreation areas,
        does not have the capacity to go to warp. The secondary hull is
        commanded from main engineering.<br>Separating is a major action
        attempted from the bridge (Operations panel) or main engineering,
        requiring a Control + Conn task with a Difficulty of 3, assisted by the
        ship&rsquo;s Structure + Engineering. Reconnecting takes a major action,
        but the process is automated and requires no task attempt. Separating
        and reconnecting cannot be completed if the ship (or either part of it)
        has suffered one or more breaches to Structure.</p>
