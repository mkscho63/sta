        <p>The character’s home was one filled with the potential of science,
        and cutting-edge developments were familiar ground. Perhaps the
        character was raised by scientists, engineers, or had mentors and
        teachers who encouraged a talent for the
        technical.</p><p></p><p>ATTRIBUTES</p><p>If the character rebelled
        against this Upbringing, they don’t lack technical talent, but they
        haven’t developed that talent and instead rely more on instinct,
        increasing their Daring by 1 and their Insight by
        2.</p><p></p><p>DEPARTMENTS, FOCUS, AND TALENT</p><p>The character’s
        familiarity with cutting-edge science and the latest research allows
        them to increase one of Conn, Engineering, Science, or Medicine by
        1.</p><p>The character’s focus should relate to the character’s favored
        fields of study and inquiry. Examples include: Astrophysics,
        Astronavigation, Computers, Cybernetics, Power Systems, Genetics,
        Physics, Subspace Communications, Surgery, Quantum Mechanics, Warp Field
        Dynamics, Xenobiology.</p><p>The character also gains a single
        talent.</p>
