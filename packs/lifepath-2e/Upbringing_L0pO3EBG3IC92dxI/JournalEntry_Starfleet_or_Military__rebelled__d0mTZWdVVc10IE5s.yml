        <p>The character’s family may have a strong tradition of naval service,
        with at least one member of the family in every generation serving their
        people in this way. Perhaps both the character’s parents served in the
        military, who met in service. Either way, the character’s formative
        years were influenced by a military life. In the Federation, this will
        normally refer to Starfleet, but it may just as easily apply to groups
        like the Bajoran Militia, the Andorian Imperial Guard, the Klingon
        Defense Fleet, Imperial Romulan Navy, or any of a number of other
        military forces.</p><p></p><p>ATTRIBUTES</p><p>If the character rebelled
        against this Upbringing, their bold and self-determined living increases
        their Daring by 2 and their Insight by 1.</p><p></p><p>DEPARTMENTS,
        FOCUS, AND TALENT</p><p>The character’s exposure to the ways and
        traditions of Starfleet allows them to increase any one department
        rating by 1.</p><p>The character’s focus should relate to their
        connection to Starfleet, covering skills learned during the character’s
        formative years. Examples include: Astronavigation, Composure,
        Extra-Vehicular Activity, Hand-to-Hand Combat (may be renamed to a
        specific martial art), Hand Phasers, Small Craft, Starfleet Protocol,
        Starship Recognition, or History.</p><p>The character also gains a
        single talent.</p>
