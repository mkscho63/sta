        <p>Klingons are a proud, martial people, native to the planet Qo’noS in
        the Beta Quadrant. Their tall, strong physiques, sharp teeth, and the
        distinctive dense crest that runs from their brow, over their heads, and
        down their spines, all contribute to an appearance that is synonymous
        with martial prowess and ferocity. Hardy and aggressive, Klingons
        combine a sense of pride and personal conviction with a fatalistic
        streak, regarding honorable death to be preferable to what they would
        deem a shameful or cowardly life.</p><p>Klingons embrace life and death
        alike without fear. They are also a people with a powerful sense of
        honor, both personal and familial, and they are quick to anger when
        attacked; the greatest slights can result in generations-long blood
        feuds.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>It is a good day to
        die!</p></li><li><p>Own the day!</p></li><li><p>Revenge is a dish best
        served cold</p></li><li><p>I am a Klingon warrior; if you doubt it, a
        demonstration can be arranged!</p><p></p></li></ul><p>ATTRIBUTES: +1
        Daring, +1 Fitness, +1 Presence</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Klingon. Klingon
        physiology is hardy, with a reinforced skeleton and many redundant
        internal organs which allow them to withstand harm and numerous toxins
        that would be deadly to other species, though this has the potential for
        medical complications. They are significantly stronger and more
        resilient than Humans, though they have less tolerance for the
        cold.</p><p></p><p>BRAK’LUL (SPECIES ABILITY): You gain 1 Protection
        which stacks with the benefits of any armor worn. Further, when another
        character attempts First Aid to heal you, they may re-roll a
        d20.</p><p></p><p>ONE NAME: Klingons have only a single name, but formal
        Klingon forms of address include the name of a parent (“son of…,”
        “daughter of…,” etc.), and then the name of their House—the extended
        family or clan they belong to.</p><p></p><p>FEMININE: Azetbur, B’Elanna,
