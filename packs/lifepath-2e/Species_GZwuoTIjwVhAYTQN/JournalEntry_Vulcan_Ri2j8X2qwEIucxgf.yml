        <p>The first species to contact Humans, Vulcans are stoic, rational
        people. Widely claimed to be emotionless, Vulcans in fact feel emotions
        deeply and intensely, to their own detriment. Ancient Vulcans were prone
        to murderous rage and fits of paranoia, and nearly destroyed themselves
        millennia ago, before Surak taught logic and the purging of emotion. His
        teachings led to peace among the Vulcans and the establishment of a
        culture driven by reason.</p><p>Vulcans embrace science and logic, but
        their lives are not purely devoted to such things: they have a deeply
        philosophical and spiritual side, with art and music as vital to their
        culture as logic. They are also an intensely private people, with many
        aspects of their culture largely kept secret from
        outsiders.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>Logic is the
        beginning of wisdom, not the end</p></li><li><p>Nothing that is, is
        unimportant</p></li><li><p>The needs of the many outweigh the needs of
        the few or the one</p></li><li><p>In accepting the inevitable, one finds
        peace</p><p></p></li></ul><p>ATTRIBUTES: +1 Control, +1 Fitness, +1
        Reason</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Vulcan. Vulcans have a naturally high
        tolerance for extremes of heat, are resistant to dehydration, and can
        shield their eyes from blinding light with a set of secondary eyelids.
        Their auditory and olfactory senses are extremely keen, and the gravity
        of their homeworld means an average Vulcan is about three times as
        strong as a Human of similar size and weight. Vulcans are innately
        telepathic, and through extensive training since childhood, Vulcan minds
        can suppress their emotional responses, and even exert influence upon
        biological processes, though this takes regular meditation to
        maintain.</p><p></p><p>MENTAL DISCIPLINE (SPECIES ABILITY): While
        Vulcans have some psychic capabilities, they require training to use it
        effectively (see the Mind Meld talent, page 154). Further, your maximum
        Stress is based on your Control rather than your Fitness, and you may
        suffer 2 Stress to avoid suffering any trait that represents an
        emotional state. However, if you become Fatigued, you increase the
        Potency of any such emotion-related trait by 1.</p><p></p><p>VULCAN
        NAMES: Vulcans have only a single name, in practical terms—while they do
        have family names, these are not discussed among other species—and tend
        to be traditional in the names they use.</p><p></p><p>MASCULINE: Aravik,
