        <p>Hailing from the planet Denobula, Denobulans are a gregarious,
        inquisitive people who have been allies of humanity since the 2130s.
        Denobulans are long-lived and highly sociable, with large
        families—Denobulans are typically polyamorous, with individuals
        potentially having several spouses, each of whom may have several
        spouses of their own, and dozens of children between them—living in
        relatively close, communal environments. Culturally, Denobulans are an
        intellectually curious people, highly perceptive, and interested in a
        wide range of philosophies, with their long lives allowing them to
        pursue a wide range of fields of study, often granting them unusual
        perspectives on the different philosophies and fields of expertise
        they’ve studied.</p><p>Denobulans enjoy learning new things, meeting new
        people, and they revel in the drama, intrigue, and gossip that come from
        a rich and complex social environment. They are extraordinarily patient,
        taking a long view of the changes that happen in life, but they dislike
        solitude, and even a busy starship or starbase can sometimes seem a
        little empty to a Denobulan.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE

        talk to them</p></li><li><p>Comfort in numbers</p></li><li><p>There's

        +1 Reason</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Denobulan. Denobulans have a robust immune
        system, but a vulnerability to various forms of radiation poisoning.
        They are adept climbers. Denobulans do not need to sleep, but must
        hibernate for several days each year, becoming disoriented if kept awake
        during this period.</p><p></p><p>BREADTH OF STUDY (SPECIES ABILITY): You
        may select two additional focuses.</p><p></p><p>DENOBULAN NAMES:
        Denobulans tend to only have a single name—an individual Denobulan may
        be part of several overlapping families. Some Denobulans may use the
        name of one of their spouses as a surname; however, this is often to
        indicate association to species that may not understand complex
        Denobulan families.</p><p></p><p>MASCULINE: Biras, Bogga, Delix, Grolik,
