        <p>An aggressive, passionate people from the frozen moon Andoria, the
        Andorians have been part of the Federation since its foundation. Their
        blue skin, pale hair, and antennae give them a distinctive appearance,
        and while the Andorian Imperial Guard was demobilized when the
        Federation was founded, they still maintain strong military traditions,
        and a tradition of ritualized honor-duels known as Ushaan, using
        razor-sharp ice-mining tools.</p><p>Andorians have developed powerful
        traditions of ritual, convention, and personal honor to help direct
        their intensity and energy towards constructive
        ends.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>I always repay my
        debts</p></li><li><p>No challenge unmet</p></li><li><p>Proud child of
        Andoria</p></li><li><p>Question my word, question my
        honor</p><p></p></li></ul><p>ATTRIBUTES: +1 Control, +1 Daring, +1
        Presence</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Andorian. This trait may reduce the
        Difficulty of tasks to resist extreme cold, or tasks impacted by
        extremely low temperatures. Their antennae aid in balance and spatial
        awareness; a lost antenna can be debilitating until it regrows.
        Andorians also have a high metabolism, meaning, among other things, that
        they tire more quickly than Humans; this also makes them more vulnerable
        to infection from certain types of injury.</p><p></p><p>INTENSE (SPECIES
        ABILITY): When you succeed at a task where you purchased one or more
        d20s by adding to Threat, you generate 1 bonus Momentum for each d20
        purchased. Bonus Momentum may not be saved.</p><p></p><p>ANDORIAN NAMES:
        Andorian names tend to be harsh-sounding, and have a personal name
        followed by a clan name. It's common to begin the clan name with a
        gender-specific prefix: “zh” or “sh” for females, and “ch” or “th” for
        males. This is placed before the family name, separated by an
        apostrophe.</p><p></p><p>FEMININE: Athytti, Vryvih, Zyle, Vyssia,
