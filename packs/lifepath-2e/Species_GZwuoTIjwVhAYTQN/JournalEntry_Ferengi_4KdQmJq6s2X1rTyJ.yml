        <p>An acquisitive species native to Ferenginar, the Ferengi are
        unimposing beings, known mostly as merchants and traders. Their culture
        promotes the accumulation of material wealth, and their society is
        capitalistic, with most routine activities accompanied by an exchange of
        money, typically in the form of gold-pressed latinum (a non-replicable
        liquid metal, suspended within “slips,” “strips,” “bars,” and “bricks”
        of gold). Ferengi society is strongly patriarchal, with female Ferengi
        traditionally disallowed from owning property or even wearing clothing
        (and male Ferengi often having deeply unpleasant attitudes towards
        non-Ferengi women), though these attitudes start to change by the late
        24th century.</p><p>Ferengi pride themselves on their ability to acquire
        wealth, though there are many different approaches to this. For
        centuries, Ferengi culture has been dominated by the philosophies and
        lessons of the Rules of Acquisition, though these can be interpreted in
        a variety of different ways and applied to a Ferengi’s
        life.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>9TH RULE: Opportunity
        plus instinct equals profit</p></li><li><p>62ND RULE: The riskier the
        road, the greater the profit</p></li><li><p>125TH RULE: You can’t make a
        deal if you’re dead</p></li><li><p>263RD RULE: Never allow doubt to
        tarnish your lust for latinum</p><p></p></li></ul><p>ATTRIBUTES: +1

        physiology does not lend itself to physical activity, nor does their
        culture value such hardship, though they have a resistance to many
        common diseases. Ferengi have exceptional hearing, and highly sensitive
        ears, though this also means that intense sounds (and physical force
        applied to the ears) can inflict debilitating pain. Their unusual brain
        structure means that telepaths cannot read Ferengi minds. Ferengi regard
        the accumulation of wealth as the highest virtue, and while this has
        given them a reputation as cunning negotiators, they are also often seen
        as duplicitous and manipulative.</p><p></p><p>THE GREAT MATERIAL
        CONTINUUM (SPECIES ABILITY): Once per session, when obtaining additional
        equipment, you may reduce the Opportunity Cost of an item by 1, to a
        minimum of 0.</p><p></p><p>FERENGI NAMES: Ferengi tend to have only a
        single name, which tend to be only one or two syllables, though
        exceptions exist. Among cultures who have family names, Ferengi will
        occasionally refer to themselves as “son of…,” “daughter of…,” “child
        of…,” and so forth, but as each Ferengi is expected to make their own
        way in life, family names are unheard of among
        Ferengi.</p><p></p><p>MASCULINE: Arridor, Berik, Bok, Broik, Frool,
