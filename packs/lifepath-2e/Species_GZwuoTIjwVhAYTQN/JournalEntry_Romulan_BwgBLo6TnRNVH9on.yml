        <p>A divergent offshoot of the Vulcan species, Romulans fled their
        original homeworld millennia ago. These Vulcans, “those who marched
        beneath the Raptor’s wings,” refused to accept the teachings of Surak,
        andthus did not embrace logic or stoicism, and eventually their ships
        would reach the worlds known as Romulus and Remus. Much of what is known
        about the Romulans has been pieced together from secondary and tertiary
        sources, as the Romulans themselves are secretive bordering on paranoia
        and do not disclose any information about themselves unless they deem it
        vital. Indeed, the Federation didn’t even know what Romulans looked like
        until a century after the EarthRomulan War.</p><p>To the Romulans, trust
        is something to be placed in only a few, for misplaced trust can be a
        deadly weapon. A Romulan trusts only their closest family members, and
        places increasing layers of secrecy, obfuscation, and misdirection as
        relationships grow more distant. There are exceptions to this, such as
        the scrupulously candid order Qowat Milat, but most Romulans are highly
        guarded and suspicious of everyone.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE
        VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>I give my life to the service of the
        Empire</p></li><li><p>Secrecy is a shield against
        betrayal</p></li><li><p>Every secret I discover is another weapon in my
        arsenal</p></li><li><p>Even my secrets have
        secrets!</p><p></p></li></ul><p>ATTRIBUTES: +1 Control, +1 Fitness, +1
        Reason</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Romulan. Romulan physiology is like that of
        Vulcans, but subtly different in a variety of ways, enough to cause
        difficulties in using medical techniques designed for Vulcans, and
        enough that, with difficulty, sensors can distinguish between Vulcan and
        Romulan life-signs. Psychologically and culturally, Romulans prize
        cunning and strength of will, and are highly distrustful of outsiders.
        Romulans have a reputation for manipulation, deception, and
        betrayal.</p><p></p><p>PARANOIA (SPECIES ABILITY): When an action scene
        begins, if the gamemaster wishes an adversary to take the first turn,
        they must spend 1 Threat more than normal.</p><p></p><p>ROMULAN NAMES:
        Romulans receive four names: a “true” name used among family, a “common”
        name used for religious rituals and other traditional purposes, an
        “Imperial” name used by the state, and an “open” name given to
        outsiders. A Romulan may even change their “open” name on a whim and may
        have several in different social contexts.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLES: Almak,
