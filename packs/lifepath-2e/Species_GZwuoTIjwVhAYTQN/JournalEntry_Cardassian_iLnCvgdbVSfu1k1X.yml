        <p>Often vilified and distrusted due to the actions of their government,
        Cardassians have a reputation for being ruthless, deceitful, and
        aggressive. Due to a dearth of natural resources and an economic
        collapse, Cardassian culture was overtaken by an oppressive
        authoritarian regime dominated by the military, which began a
        decades-long campaign of expansion, conquest, and exploitation,
        including the occupation of Bajor and a lengthy border conflict with the
        Federation. In the aftermath of the Dominion War, with the military
        government overthrown, the rebuilding of Cardassia was a difficult
        process, not least because of long-held feelings of resentment towards
        the Cardassians.</p><p>Cardassians are a creative, dedicated people,
        with a strong cultural fascination with intrigue. Cardassians are
        inclined to keep secrets, and to regard suspicion as wisdom, and the
        uncovering of secrets is regarded as a valuable
        skill.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>Everyone is guilty of
        something, but who and of what?</p></li><li><p>State above family;
        family above self</p></li><li><p>If you don't want me knowing, hide it

        lies</p><p></p></li></ul><p>ATTRIBUTES: +1 Control, +1 Presence, +1
        Reason</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Cardassian. Cardassians are a
        pseudo-reptilian species, used to an environment somewhat warmer and
        more humid than is comfortable for Humans, and tend to find bright light
        uncomfortable. Their culture prizes mental discipline and obedience to
        strict hierarchies and they have a reputation for arrogance, cruelty,
        and smug superiority.</p><p></p><p>HEALTHY SUSPICIONS (SPECIES ABILITY):
        You may add 1 Threat when interacting with an NPC to ask the gamemaster
        if that NPC is lying about something. The gamemaster must answer either
        Yes or No, and this answer must be accurate, but the gamemaster does not
        have to specify what the NPC is lying about.</p><p></p><p>CARDASSIAN
