        <p>The Trill are a pair of species who originate from a world of the
        same name. The Trill that most outsiders know appear almost identical to
        Humans or Betazoids, but for a row of irregular spots running down the
        sides of their bodies. The other Trill species are small invertebrates,
        which dwell in subterranean caverns. There are relatively few of this
        second species, species, but they are extremely intelligent and capable
        of living for centuries.</p><p>While not a secret, it is not widely
        discussed that a small portion of humanoid Trill are capable of bonding
        with the invertebrates, commonly referred to as symbionts, and in this
        bond—called a Joining—creates a gestalt person, a combination of the
        minds, memories, and personalities of both creatures. While a symbiont
        cannot be removed without killing its host, upon a host’s death, a
        symbiont will be passed to a new host, preserving knowledge and memory
        over generations.</p><p>Trill society has been shaped by the Joined,
        with Trill culture tending to take a long view of social development,
        and pursuing intellectual and philosophical development over
        interpersonal conflict. The Trill are a firm and dedicated member of the
        Federation.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>Several lifetimes
        of experience</p></li><li><p>What will this mean a century from
        now?</p></li><li><p>What can I discover today?</p></li><li><p>Who I was
        is only part of who I am</p><p></p></li></ul><p>ATTRIBUTES: +1 Control,
        +1 Presence, +1 Reason</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Trill. Trill are especially
        resistant to parasites and similar intrusion. However, they tend to have
        strong allergic reactions to insect bites and other venoms, which can
        disrupt their neurochemistry, especially if they are Joined. Many of the
        specifics of Trill physiology—specifically with regards to symbionts—are
        not widely understood by non-Trill doctors, which can result in medical
        complications. Many Joined Trill find using a transporter to be
        uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>PATIENT (SPECIES ABILITY): When you succeed
        at a task where you purchased one or more d20s by spending Momentum, you
        generate 1 bonus Momentum for each d20 purchased. Bonus Momentum may not
        be saved.</p><p></p><p>TRILL NAMES: Trill names consist of a personal
        name and a family name, though in the case of a joined Trill, the family
        name is replaced with the name of the symbiont.</p><p></p><p>FEMININE:
