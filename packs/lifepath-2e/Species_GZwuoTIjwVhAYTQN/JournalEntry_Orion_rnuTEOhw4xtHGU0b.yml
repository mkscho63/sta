        <p>A species with a colorful reputation, the Orions are subject to
        rumor, speculation, and flights of fancy, to the point where there are
        numerous common misconceptions about their species and culture. This
        seems to be at least partially by design. Orions are accustomed to
        taking full advantage of any opportunity that passes their way, and the
        uncertainty and misdirection that surrounds them is a considerable
        advantage. The influence of Orion traders and the Orion Syndicate can be
        felt across the Alpha and Beta Quadrants, often in ways that flout the
        laws of other cultures, and often employing agents of other
        species.</p><p>Orion culture appears to be divided along gender lines,
        and there is evidence to suggest they have a broadly matriarchal
        culture, with the women serving in leadership roles, while Orion males
        more often serving as muscle, laborers, and minor operatives, though
        this has shifted somewhat over the centuries. This appears to be due to
        a trait of some Orion females, who have been observed to produce
        pheromones that can make male Orions (and males of some other species,
        including Humans) compliant. It isn’t known how widespread this trait
        is.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>Everything has a

        tolerances to Humans and are physically and culturally well-accustomed
        to interstellar travel. The Orions’ reputation as thieves, pirates, and
        illicit traders can make others wary of them, but it can also open doors
        and create opportunities in more unsavory parts of the
        Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>NEVER AT FACE VALUE (SPECIES ABILITY): Once per
        scene, you may add 1 Threat to ask the gamemaster a question about the
        situation, as if you had spent Momentum to Obtain
        Information.</p><p></p><p>ORION NAMES: Orions tend to be known by a
        single name; separate personal and family names are known to exist, but
        in most cases, an Orion will only use one name—either a personal or
        family name, or a nickname they’ve adopted—unless they need to
        distinguish themselves from another similarly-named
        Orion.</p><p></p><p>FEMININE: D’Nesh, Devna, D’Vana, Gaila, Maras,
