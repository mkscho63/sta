        <p>The peaceful Betazoid people hail from the idyllic, verdant world
        Betazed. The world has long been a valued member of the Federation, and
        its people can be found across Federation space, including Starfleet.
        Betazoids appear almost identical to Humans but differ in one major way:
        they are naturally telepathic, developing mental abilities during
        adolescence. The potency of this ability varies between
        individuals.</p><p>Due to their widespread telepathy, Betazoids have a
        culture of honesty and directness—there is little reason to be evasive
        or deceitful in a culture where everyone can read your mind and sense
        your emotions. Among non-telepaths, and even telepaths of other species,
        this can result in some Betazoids seeming blunt or even rude. Betazoids
        who spend a lot of time among other cultures tend to either lean into
        this notion or choose to temper their honesty with
        tact.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>A lie is a story told in

        telepathic to varyingdegrees, and even when not actively using their
        abilities, they are highly perceptive of others around them, but also
        highly sensitive to telepathic disturbances and mental assaults. They
        have little familiarity with lies and deception, due to their open
        culture and ability to read the thoughts and emotions of others. As they
        are sensitive to the minds of other living beings, they tend not to be
        comfortable around animals, for fear of losing themselves in the minds
        of wild creatures. Similarly, they can find species immune to telepathy
        to be off-putting.</p><p></p><p>TELEPATHIC (SPECIES ABILITY): Betazoids
        can sense the minds of living creatures in their vicinity and can read
        the thoughts and emotions of others. Each Betazoid has either Telepathy
        or Empathy (see page 155-page 156 for more details). Part-Betazoid
        characters generally have Empathy rather than
        Telepathy.</p><p></p><p>BETAZOID NAMES: Betazoids tend to have names
        with at least two syllables and a melodic sound, with a personal name
        followed by a family name. Betazoids are traditionally matriarchal, with
        children taking their mother’s family name.</p><p></p><p>FEMININE:
