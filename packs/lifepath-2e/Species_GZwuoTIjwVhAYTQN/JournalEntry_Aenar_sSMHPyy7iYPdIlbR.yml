        <p>The Aenar are a subspecies of Andorians originally native to an
        isolated region of the northern wastes of Andoria. Though typically
        blind, they are telepathic, and their other senses are heightened. Once
        believed to be a myth, the Aenar are few and most prefer to remain
        within their isolated settlements, and they rarely bother themselves
        with matters outside their own communities. They lack the distinctive
        blue skin pigmentation of other Andorians, instead having skin tones
        that range from white, to ice blue, to pale gray. Aenar deplore
        violence, and commonly follow a strictly pacifist
        ideology.</p><p>Compared to their Andorian kin, Aenar often seem calm
        and restrained. They are no less proud of their heritage, but they
        express that pride differently, often taking great pride in their skills
        and the work they do. The few Aenar who leave their homeworld often come
        off as highly motivated and sure of themselves, maintaining their sense
        of self even when far from their families.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE
        VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>Do not mistake my blindness for
        helplessness</p></li><li><p>I perceive things your eyes do
        not</p></li><li><p>Life is incomplete without
        purpose</p></li><li><p>Pacifism is not
        passive</p><p></p></li></ul><p>ATTRIBUTES: +1 Control, +1 Insight, +1
        Presence</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Aenar. Biologically similar to Andorians,
        Aenar differ in a number of ways. Aenar are typically blind, but their
        other senses are heightened to a degree that more than compensates for
        their lack of sight. They are also telepathic which further contributes
        to their awareness of their environment. Aenar are typically pacifists,
        and thus may be reluctant, or even outright refuse, to carry out violent
        acts.</p><p></p><p>TELEPATHIC (SPECIES ABILITY): Aenar can sense the
        minds of other living creatures in their vicinity, and can read the
        thoughts of others, though they have strict taboos about reading a mind
        without permission. See the Telepathy talent on page 156 for more
        details.</p><p></p><p>AENAR NAMES: Aenar names are much like Andorian
        names (see opposite page), though the Aenar place less emphasis on their
        clan names.</p>
