        <p>A spiritual, dauntless people from the planet Bajor, the Bajorans
        lost much after decades of occupation by the Cardassian Union. Many
        Bajorans were scattered across the Alpha Quadrant as they fled the
        Occupation, while those who remained on Bajor often toiled in labor
        camps or fought as insurgents. The Occupation ended in 2369, but the
        scars it left will take generations to heal. Bajor sought membership in
        the Federation soon afterwards (though this application was delayed by
        the Dominion War), but many Bajorans have found their way into
        Starfleet. Bajoran culture places a strong belief in the Prophets,
        celestial beings who are said to have watched over Bajor for millennia;
        modern religious doctrine states the Bajoran wormhole is the Prophets’
        Celestial Temple.</p><p>Bajoran spirituality has long been a powerful
        factor in their lives, even for Bajorans who did not believe strongly in
        the Prophets. The unifying presence of their religion provided a source
        of hope and courage. A common sign of this faith is the D’ja pagh, a
        symbolic earring.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>I help

        TRAIT: Bajoran. Bajorans tend to be hostile towards Cardassians, and
        resentful of those who are dismissive of, or turned a blind eye to, the
        suffering of the Bajoran people. While not all Bajorans are spiritual or
        religious to the same degree, most have a cultural understanding of the
        Prophets’ place in their society.</p><p></p><p>THE WILL OF THE PROPHETS
        (SPECIES ABILITY): You may find strength in the Prophets even when the
        situation is dire: once per adventure, when the gamemaster spends 3 or
        more Threat at once, you gain 1 Determination.</p><p></p><p>BAJORAN
        NAMES: Traditional Bajoran names begin with the family name, followed by
        a personal name, though some diaspora Bajorans place their personal name
        first as is common in many other cultures. Bajor is traditionally
        matriarchal, with children taking their mother’s family
        name.</p><p></p><p>FEMININE: Adami, Chami, Fala, Jaxa, Laren, Lipras,
