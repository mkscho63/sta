        <p>The stubborn, argumentative Tellarite species originated upon Tellar
        Prime, a temperate planet in the Alpha Quadrant. Their bodies are
        thick-set and covered in dense hair, and they stand a little shorter
        than Humans on average. Many male Tellarites possess tusks to some
        degree, though they vary in size and prominence.</p><p>Tellarites are
        known to be highly argumentative, even rude by the standards of other
        cultures, often complaining frequently or insulting others as part of
        social interactions. In truth, this comes from a sense of intellectual
        honesty and rigorous skepticism. To a Tellarite, no idea, concept or
        person is beyond challenge or analysis, and any notion that cannot stand
        up to scrutiny is an unworthy one. Tellarites revel in debates, and
        enjoy arguing, and the criticisms, complaints, and insults issued during
        conversations are intended to be met in kind: to do otherwise is to
        display a weak character, an inability to stand up for oneself, or an
        unwillingness to confront one’s own flaws.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE
        VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>No notion is above proper
        scrutiny</p></li><li><p>No voice silenced, no perspective
        unheard</p></li><li><p>You’ll never get an answer if you don’t ask
        questions</p></li><li><p>An idea left unchallenged can be
        dangerous</p></li></ul><p></p><p>ATTRIBUTES: +1 Control, +1 Fitness, +1
        Insight</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Tellarite. Tellarites have keen senses of
        smell and hearing, and excellent spatial awareness, allowing them to
        judge distance, depth, and dimension with considerable accuracy. They
        have a high tolerance for many common drugs, toxins, and inebriants
        (Tellarites don’t get drunk, just ‘feisty’).</p><p></p><p>STURDY
        (SPECIES ABILITY): You gain +1 Protection against Stun Attacks only.
        Further, when you suffer a complication that represents a physical
        hindrance or being stunned, dazed, or disoriented, you may take 1 Stress
        to ignore that complication (and remove any associated
        trait).</p><p></p><p>TELLARITE NAMES: Tellarites have considerable
        variation in their names, but all tend to be composed of harsh, even
        guttural sounds. Tellarite names consist of a personal name and a family
        name, though the family name is sometimes a compound, indicating the
        family name is a patronym or matronym (the name of a father or mother,
        respectively), toponym (derived from a place) or
        similar.</p><p></p><p>FEMININE: Pola, Cherthish, Zhuggaa, Torthem,
