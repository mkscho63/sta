        <p>Originating on the planet Earth in the Sol system, Humans are a hardy
        and ambitious species, who went from the brink of mutual annihilation to
        a united peaceful society in less than a century. A century after that,
        humanity had established itself as part of an interplanetary alliance,
        the United Federation of Planets, bringing former rivals together as
        allies. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy in their nature—sometimes
        strongly emotional and passionate like Klingons or Andorians, yet at
        others highly analytical and rational like Tellarites or Vulcans—which
        has allowed them to grow beyond their warlike and fractious past, but
        their capacity for ambition and aggression are as much a part of their
        success as their curiosity and analytical minds.</p><p>Humans tend to
        draw upon two sets of cultural values. As a central and founding member
        of the Federation, the traditions and ideals of the Federation (or even
        those of Starfleet) are often regarded as synonymous with “Human
        culture” (though the Federation draws a lot from each of its members),
        to the point where nobody is entirely sure where Earth ends and the
        Federation begins. Yet, conversely, this can also lead to Humans finding
        value in preserving the traditions and cultures of their pre-warp
        ancestors.</p><p></p><p>SAMPLE VALUES:</p><ul><li><p>I believe in what
        the Federation stands for</p></li><li><p>Learn something new every
        day</p></li><li><p>We are stronger together</p></li><li><p>Seek out new
        life and new civilizations</p><p></p></li></ul><p>ATTRIBUTES: Add 1 each
        to any three attributes.</p><p></p><p>TRAIT: Human. Humans are adaptable
        and resilient, and their resolve and ambition often allow them to resist
        great hardship and triumph despite great adversity. However, Humans can
        also be reckless, stubborn, irrational, and
        unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>FAITH OF THE HEART (SPECIES ABILITY): When
        you use one of your values to spend or gain Determination, you may also
        add 1 Momentum to the group pool.</p><p></p><p>HUMAN NAMES: Players may
        use a variety of sources for names, considering the vast range of
        real-world languages, cultures, and traditions to draw from.</p>
