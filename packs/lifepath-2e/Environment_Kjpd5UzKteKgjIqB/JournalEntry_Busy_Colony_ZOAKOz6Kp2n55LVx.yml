        <p>The character comes from one of their culture’s oldest or most
        prosperous colonies, which may be another world within their home
        system—such as Luna or Mars for Humans—or one of the first worlds
        colonized after the culture achieved interstellar flight. These colonies
        often develop a fiercely independent outlook, often having developed
        with little direct aid from their home world, and a sense of pride that
        accompanies being among the first of their kind to tame another
        world.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>VALUE: At this step, the character gains a
        single value. This value should reflect the environment and culture the
        character was raised within. Consider how the character views their own
        culture, and how they connect—or possibly, don’t connect—to the
        philosophies and traditions of their people.</p></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTE:
        Choose one of the following attributes and increase it by 1: Daring or
        Presence</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENT: Choose one of Command, Security, or
        Science; the character increases that department by 1.</p></li></ul>
