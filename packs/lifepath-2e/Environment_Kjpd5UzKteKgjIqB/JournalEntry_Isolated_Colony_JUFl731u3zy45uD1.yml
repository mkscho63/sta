        <p>The character comes from a colony that is isolated from broader
        galactic society. Worlds like the Vulcan monastery on P’Jem use the vast
        distances between star systems as an opportunity for contemplative
        isolation, while others are settled because they present unique research
        opportunities. The cultures of these colonies tend to focus on learning
        and introspection.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>VALUE: At this step, the
        character gains a single value. This value should reflect the
        environment and culture the character was raised within. This is a good
        opportunity to consider how the character views their own culture, and
        how they connect—or possibly, don’t connect—to the philosophies and
        traditions of their people.</p></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTE: Choose one of the
        following attributes and increase it by 1: Reason or
        Insight.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENT: Choose one of Engineering, Science,
        or Medicine; increase that department by 1.</p></li></ul>
