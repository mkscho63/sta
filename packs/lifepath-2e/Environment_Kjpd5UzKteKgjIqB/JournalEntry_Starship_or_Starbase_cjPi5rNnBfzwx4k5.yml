        <p>The character grew up in space, travelling aboard a starship or
        living aboard a space station or starbase. While they’re unlikely to
        have lived aboard a military or Starfleet vessel—only some of them carry
        families—many freighters, transports, and other civilian vessels have a
        tradition of family or generational crews, and many officers with
        families take postings to starbases rather than ships. </p><p>Those
        raised in space learn the ins-and-outs of shipboard life as children,
        and many are groomed for leadership, or learn to fly a shuttle in their
        formative years.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>VALUE: At this step, the character
        gains a single value. This value should reflect the environment and
        culture the character was raised within. This is a good opportunity to
        consider how the character views their own culture, and how they
        connect—or possibly, don’t connect—to the philosophies and traditions of
        their people.</p></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTE: Choose one of the following
        attributes and increase it by 1: Control or
        Insight</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENT: Choose one of Command, Conn, or
        Engineering; the character increases that department by 1.</p></li></ul>
