        <p>The character comes from a colony located on the fringes of known
        space, either on the edge of uncharted space or on the border with
        another civilization. Frontier colonists tend to be hardy and
        determined, even stubborn, and well-prepared for the dangers that their
        home may pose.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>VALUE: At this step, the character
        gains a single value. This value should reflect the environment and
        culture the character was raised within. This is a good opportunity to
        consider how the character views their own culture, and how they
        connect—or possibly, don’t connect—to the philosophies and traditions of
        their people.</p></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTE: Choose one of the following
        attributes and increase it by 1: Control or
        Fitness.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENT: Choose one of Conn, Security, or
        Medicine; increase that department by 1.</p></li></ul>
