        <p>You exchange money for goods or services. Within the Federation, the
        actual transactions are a trivial matter, but other civilizations still
        make more overt use of money, with gold-pressed latinum serving as a
        common economic standard, easily exchanged for the Cardassian lek,
        Bajoran lita, or Klingon darsek. You’re a part of that galactic economy,
        providing a service or trading in valua ble goods (or both) in exchange
        for latinum, currency, or other goods or services in
        turn.</p><p>Starbases and space stations are a good place to find
        civilian traders, as they’re hubs of activity that see lots of traffic.
        Starships—particularly exploratory vessels—may take a trader aboard as a
        guide or local expert when venturing through unfamiliar regions of
        space.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Quark (Deep Space Nine),
        Cleveland "Book" Booker (Discovery)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT: The
        character gains the trait Merchant. This can be adjusted further to
        reflect the character’s specific profession, such as Bartender or Free
        Trader.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: You gain a single value, which should
        reflect the character’s beliefs developed during their career, or which
        led them to become a merchant in the first place. Examples
        include:</p><ul><li><p>Today’s strangers are tomorrow’s
        customers</p></li><li><p>When all your needs are met, it’s the
        experience that matters</p></li><li><p>You wouldn’t begrudge me a little
        profit in this venture?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES: You gain
        three points, which may be divided among two or three attributes freely
        (either one gets 2 and the other gets 1, or all three get 1). At least
        one of the attributes you increase must be Insight or Presence, as a
        successful trader is often a “people
        person.”</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS: You increase your Command by 2, and
        two other departments by 1. In addition, you may reduce one of your
        other departments by 1 and add that point to any department not already
        increased.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: You select three focuses. Examples
        include:</p><ul><li><p>Art, Cooking, Psychology, Economics, Logistics,
        Persuasion, Tailoring, Disruptors</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TALENT: The
        character gains a single talent.</p></li></ul>
