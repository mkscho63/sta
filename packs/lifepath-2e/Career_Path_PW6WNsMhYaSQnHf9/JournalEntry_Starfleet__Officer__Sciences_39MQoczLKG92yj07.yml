        <section class="journal-page-content"><p>You are a Starfleet officer,
        and a graduate of Starfleet Academy. After passing grueling entrance
        exams, you spent four years at the Academy, dividing your time between
        academic study, physical training, and gaining practical experience.
        Much of your time was spent at the main campus in San Francisco on
        Earth, but you probably also spent time at other facilities across the
        Federation, as well as aboard starships and starbases. A graduate of the
        Academy receives a commission as an officer of Starfleet, holding the
        rank of ensign, after which they are assigned to their first posting.
        Some cadets—particularly those pursuing a higher education, such as a
        doctorate—extend their time at the Academy by a year or two, and
        graduate at the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade).</p><p>The Academy
        provides different training depending upon a cadet’s aptitudes and
        desired role within Starfleet, referred to as track. When you select
        this option, choose (or roll on the Random Starfleet Division table)
        which Academy track the character pursues:</p><p>Command, Operations, or
        Sciences.</p><p></p><p>SCIENCES TRACK</p><p>Somewhat isolated from the
        other tracks, the Sciences track is primarily academic, with Starfleet
        Academy producing many accomplished scientists. Included within the
        Sciences track, but separated by a distinct curriculum, is Starfleet
        Medical, training doctors, nurses, and counselors to serve aboard
        Starfleet vessels and facilities across the
        Federation.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Spock (Star Trek), Saru
        (Discovery)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT: The character gains the trait
        Starfleet Officer. The character may also gain a trait reflecting their
        specific profession and the accompanying advanced training, such as
        Physician, or Psychiatrist.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: The character gains a
        single value, which should reflect some aspect of the character’s
        beliefs that developed during their time at the Academy. Examples
        include:</p><ul><li><p>No conclusions until I’ve run some
        tests</p></li><li><p>I want to see what nobody else has
        seen</p></li><li><p>First, do no
        harm</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES: The character gains three
        points, which may be split between two or three attributes (increase
        three attributes by 1 each, or increase one by 2 and another by 1). The
        character may pick these attributes freely.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS:
        The player must select either Science or Medicine as the character’s
        major—the subject they studied most intensely. This department is
        increased by 2. Then, the player selects two other departments—the
        character’s minor subjects—which are increased by 1 each. A character
        may not have any department higher than 4 at this
        stage.</p><ul><li><p>FOCUSES: The character selects three focuses, at
        least one of which should relate to the character’s chosen track.
        Examples include:</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Anthropology, Astrophysics,
        Botany, Computers, Cybernetics, Emergency Medicine, Exo-tectonics,
        Genetics, Geology, Infectious Diseases, Linguistics, Physics,
        Psychiatry, Quantum Mechanics, Trauma Surgery, Virology, Warp Field
        Dynamics, Xenobiology</p></li><li><p>TALENT: The character gains a
        single talent.</p></li></ul></section>
