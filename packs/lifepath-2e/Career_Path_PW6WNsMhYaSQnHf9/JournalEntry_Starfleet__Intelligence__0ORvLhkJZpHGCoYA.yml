        <p>Starfleet maintains an intelligence division which monitors and
        analyzes the activities of its neighbors, assessing threats, identifying
        future problems or challenges, and carrying out covert operations. A lot
        of this work is passive, carried out as a natural part of Starfleet’s
        operations, by analysts and computer algorithms sifting through mission
        logs, sensor records, and similar data, but it cannot be done
        exclusively in this way.</p><p>Starfleet Intelligence recruits
        operatives and assets across the Federation, and sometimes even
        beyond.</p><p>Most established operatives are handlers and analysts,
        gathering information from a variety of sources and establishing their
        own networks of informants, who live ordinary lives and only
        occasionally pass on information. When Starfleet Intelligence needs to
        perform more significant actions, it often selects personnel from
        elsewhere in Starfleet to carry out the work. Many starbases and a few
        starships have an Intelligence officer on board, who serve as a point of
        contact for their commanding officers and spend much of their time
        gathering and summarizing information that may be of use to ongoing
        missions.</p><p>Other civilizations in the Galaxy have comparable
        intelligence agencies, such as the Romulan Tal Shiar or the Cardassian
        Obsidian Order, both of which are infamous examples feared both within
        and beyond those civilizations.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS:

        Intelligence Operative.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: The character gains a

        verify</p></li><li><p>Insufficient information can result in

        points, which may be split between two or three attributes (increase

        character may pick these attributes freely.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS:
        The player must select one of Command or Security and increase it by 2.

        character may not have any department higher than 4 at this
        stage.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: The character selects three focuses, at
