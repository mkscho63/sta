        <section class="journal-page-content"><p>You are a Starfleet officer,
        and a graduate of Starfleet Academy. After passing grueling entrance
        exams, you spent four years at the Academy, dividing your time between
        academic study, physical training, and gaining practical experience.
        Much of your time was spent at the main campus in San Francisco on
        Earth, but you probably also spent time at other facilities across the
        Federation, as well as aboard starships and starbases. A graduate of the
        Academy receives a commission as an officer of Starfleet, holding the
        rank of ensign, after which they are assigned to their first posting.
        Some cadets—particularly those pursuing a higher education, such as a
        doctorate—extend their time at the Academy by a year or two, and
        graduate at the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade).</p><p>The Academy
        provides different training depending upon a cadet’s aptitudes and
        desired role within Starfleet, referred to as track. When you select
        this option, choose (or roll on the Random Starfleet Division table)
        which Academy track the character pursues:</p><p>Command, Operations, or
        Sciences.</p><p></p><p>COMMAND TRACK</p><p>The Command track is for
        those cadets who aspire to command their own starship someday. It
        focuses on leadership and interpersonal skills, diplomacy,
        decision-making in crisis situations, an understanding of protocol and
        procedure, and starship operations, which includes flight control. Many
        Command track cadets begin their careers as flight control officers and
        pilots, where their training can be put to the test on a smaller scale
        while they gain the experience necessary for more authority and
        responsibility. Command track cadets customarily undertake the infamous
        Kobayashi Maru test during their final year.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE
        CHARACTERS: James T. Kirk (Star Trek), Kathryn Janeway
        (Voyager)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT: The character gains the trait
        Starfleet Officer.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: The character gains a single
        value, which should reflect some aspect of the character’s beliefs that
        developed during their time at the Academy. Examples
        include:</p><ul><li><p>Starfleet is a promise: I’d give my life for you,
        you’d give your life for me, and nobody gets left
        behind.</p></li><li><p>The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to
        the truth. The Prime Directive is there to remind us that we are not
        gods, and should not act like them.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES:
        The character gains three points, which may be split between two or
        three attributes (increase three attributes by 1 each, or increase one
        by 2 and another by 1). The character may pick these attributes
        freely.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS: The player must select either
        Command or Conn as the character’s major—the subject they studied most
        intensely. This department is increased by 2. Then, the player selects
        two other departments—the character’s minor subjects—which are increased
        by 1 each. A character may not have any department higher than 4 at this
        stage.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: The character selects three focuses, at
        least one of which should relate to the character’s chosen track.
        Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Astronavigation, Composure, Diplomacy,
        Extra-Vehicular Activity, Evasive Action, Helm Operations, Inspiration,
        Persuasion, Small Craft, Starship Recognition, Starfleet Protocols, Team
        Dynamics</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TALENT: The character gains a single
        talent.</p></li></ul></section>
