        <p>You’ve devoted your life to healing others. You may be trained as a
        doctor, a paramedic, a counselor, or you may be a medical researcher
        rather than a practicing physician, but either way, the goal is to help
        people who are hurt in some way. Your skills are in demand across
        explored space, and even civilian-trained physicians can find themselves
        aboard Starfleet and military ships.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS:
        Phlox (Enterprise)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT: The character gains the
        trait Physician. This can be adjusted to reflect a particular specialty,
        such as Surgeon or Geneticist.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: You gain a single
        value, which should reflect the character’s beliefs developed during
        their studies, or which led them to enter medicine in the first place.
        Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>The Hippocratic Oath</p></li><li><p>I
        must respect my patient’s wishes</p></li><li><p>An ounce of prevention
        is worth a pound of cure</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES: You gain
        three points, which may be divided among two or three attributes freely
        (either one gets 2 and the other gets 1, or all three get 1). These may
        be assigned freely.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS: You increase your
        Medicine by 2, and two other departments by 1. In addition, you may
        reduce one of your other departments by 1 and add that point to any
        department not already increased.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: You select
        three focuses. Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Emergency Medicine,
        Surgery, Psychiatry, Virology, Cybernetics, Genetics,
        Xenobiology</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TALENT: The character gains a
        single talent.</p></li></ul>
