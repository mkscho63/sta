        <p>You pursue scientific truth or technological progress, seeking to
        become your generation’s Zephram Cochrane or Richard Daystrom. You
        probably specialize in a single field of scientific study or technical
        expertise, or a small number of related fields. You may end up working
        with Starfleet or a military, but this is more because they are
        interested in your work.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Leah Brahms
        (The Next Generation), Ruon Tarka
        (Discovery)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT: The character gains the trait
        Scientist or Engineer. Adjust this to reflect the specifics of the
        character’s profession, such as Cyberneticist or Transporter
        Expert.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: You gain a single value, which should
        reflect the character’s beliefs developed during their studies, or which
        led them to pursue science or engineering in the first place. Examples
        include:</p><ul><li><p>I have devoted my career to this
        research</p></li><li><p>Science allows us to seek truth and
        understanding</p></li><li><p>With the right tools, we can solve any
        problem</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES: You gain three points,
        which may be divided among two or three attributes freely (either one
        gets 2 and the other gets 1, or all three get 1). At least one of the
        attributes you increase must be Reason, as nobody gets far in science or
        engineering without a keen intellect.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS: You
        increase your Science of Engineering by 2, and two other departments by
        1. In addition, you may reduce one of your other departments by 1 and
        add that point to any department not already
        increased.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: You select three focuses. Examples
        include:</p><ul><li><p>Astrophysics, Botany, Cybernetics, Exo-Tectonics,
        Genetics, Quantum Mechanics, Subspace Mechanics, Temporal Mechanics,
        Transporters and Replicators, Warp Field
        Dynamics</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TALENT: The character gains a single
        talent.</p></li></ul>
