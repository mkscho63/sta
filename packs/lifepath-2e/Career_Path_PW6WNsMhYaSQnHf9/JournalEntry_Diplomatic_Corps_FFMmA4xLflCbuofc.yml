        <p>Whether you’ve spent a lifetime in politics and diplomacy, or you
        became an honorary diplomat after an illustrious career, you are now
        part of the network of ambassadors and envoys who connect distant worlds
        and interstellar nations.</p><p>When entering diplomatic service, you
        may speak on behalf of a single world, or on behalf of an interplanetary
        entity such as the Federation. The most respected diplomats may be
        roving ambassadors-at-large, leveraging their reputation and experience
        to arrange summits and treaties and speak on major international
        matters, constantly moving from place to place as the situation
        demands.</p><p>Starfleet, and the militaries of other civilizations,
        commonly provide protection and support for diplomatic missions, and
        thus ambassadors can often be found on Starfleet vessels and
        similar.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Sarek (Star Trek), Curzon Dax
        (Deep Space Nine)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT: The character gains the
        trait Diplomat or Ambassador. You may adjust this to reflect the
        specifics of your diplomatic posting, noting who you represent, where
        you’re posted, or both: for example, Federation Ambassador-at-large, or
        Klingon Ambassador to Vulcan.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: The character gains
        a single value, which should reflect some aspect of the character’s
        beliefs that developed during their time in diplomatic service. Examples
        include:</p><ul><li><p>Eventually, everyone comes back to the tableto
        talk</p></li><li><p>The right words can shape countless
        lives</p></li><li><p>You don’t get a better world if you don’t work for
        it</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES: The character gains three
        points, which may be split between two or three attributes (increase
        three attributes by 1 each, or increase one by 2 and another by 1). The
        character may pick these attributes freely.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS:
        The player increases Command by 2. Then, choose any two other
        departments, and increase them by 1 each. A character may not have any
        department higher than 4 at this stage.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: The
        character selects three focuses, at least one of which should relate to
        whichever department was increased by 2. Examples
        include:</p><ul><li><p>Anthropology, Composure, Diplomacy, Espionage,
        History, Linguistics, Literature, Persuasion, Philosophy,
        Politics</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TALENT: The character gains a single
        talent.</p></li></ul>
