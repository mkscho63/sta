        <p>You are a civil servant, operating within the structure of a
        civilization to ensure that if continues to function smoothly and to the
        benefit of its people. Your role may be narrowly focused upon a specific
        area of government, or you may be responsible for overseeing large
        departments or ministries, your decisions impacting millions or even
        billions of lives. Either way, your role is important, and you take
        pride in the necessary work you carry out. Such officials may have
        duties that require travel aboard a starship, or being stationed on a
        starbase. Starbases often have a large civilian population,
        necessitating a civilian administration parallel with a Starfleet or
        military command.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Nathan Samuels
        (Enterprise), Shakaar Edon (Deep Space Nine)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT:
        The character gains a trait which reflects their title or role, such as
        Administrator. This should be adjusted to fit the specific title the
        character possesses.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: You gain a single value,
        which should reflect the character’s beliefs developed during their
        studies, or which led them to enter public service in the first place.
        Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Keeping the wheels of civilization
        turning is vital</p></li><li><p>My decisions can affect a great many
        people; I must choose carefully</p></li><li><p>The law should serve the
        needs of the people</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES: You gain three
        points, which may be divided among two or three attributes freely
        (either one gets 2 and the other gets 1, or all three get 1). At least
        one of the attributes you increase must be Insight or Presence, as good
        instincts and a strong personality are valuable for getting into
        office.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS: You increase your Command by 2, and
        two other departments by 1. In addition, you may reduce one of your
        other departments by 1 and add that point to any department not already
        increased.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: You select three focuses. Examples
        include:</p><ul><li><p>Bureaucracy, Diplomacy, Politics, Linguistics,
        History, Philosophy, or something related to your role in public
        service</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TALENT: The character gains a single
        talent.</p></li></ul>
