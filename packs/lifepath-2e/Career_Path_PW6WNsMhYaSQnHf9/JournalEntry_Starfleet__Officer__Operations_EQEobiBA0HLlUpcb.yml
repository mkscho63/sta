        <section class="journal-page-content"><p>You are a Starfleet officer,
        and a graduate of Starfleet Academy. After passing grueling entrance
        exams, you spent four years at the Academy, dividing your time between
        academic study, physical training, and gaining practical experience.
        Much of your time was spent at the main campus in San Francisco on
        Earth, but you probably also spent time at other facilities across the
        Federation, as well as aboard starships and starbases. A graduate of the
        Academy receives a commission as an officer of Starfleet, holding the
        rank of ensign, after which they are assigned to their first posting.
        Some cadets—particularly those pursuing a higher education, such as a
        doctorate—extend their time at the Academy by a year or two, and
        graduate at the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade).</p><p>The Academy
        provides different training depending upon a cadet’s aptitudes and
        desired role within Starfleet, referred to as track. When you select
        this option, choose (or roll on the Random Starfleet Division table)
        which Academy track the character pursues:</p><p>Command, Operations, or
        Sciences.</p><p></p><p>OPERATIONS TRACK</p><p>The Operations track is
        practical and hands-on, dealing with many of the realities of
        Starfleet’s mission. Divided broadly into Engineering and Security
        divisions, Operations track cadets are defined by a sense of pragmatism,
        whether that applies to the technical or the
        tactical.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE CHARACTERS: Samanthan Rutherford (Lower
        Decks), Liam Shaw (Picard)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT: The character
        gains the trait Starfleet Officer.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: The character
        gains a single value, which should reflect some aspect of the
        character’s beliefs that developed during their time at the Academy.
        Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Get it done right the first
        time</p></li><li><p>Sometimes, you just have to
        improvise</p></li><li><p>By the book isn’t worth much in
        practice</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES: The character gains three
        points, which may be split between two or three attributes (increase
        three attributes by 1 each, or increase one by 2 and another by 1). The
        character may pick these attributes freely.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS:
        The player must select either Engineering or Security as the character’s
        major—the subject they studied most intensely. This department is
        increased by 2. Then, the player selects two other departments—the
        character’s minor subjects—which are increased by 1 each. A character
        may not have any department higher than 4 at this
        stage.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: The character selects three focuses, at
        least one of which should relate to the character’s chosen track.
        Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Computers, Cybernetics, Electro-Plasma
        Power Systems, Espionage, Hand Phasers, Hand-to-Hand Combat,
        Infiltration, Interrogation, Shipboard Tactical Systems, Survival,
        Transporters &amp; Replicators, Warp Field
        Dynamics</p></li></ul></li><li><p>TALENT: The character gains a single
        talent.</p></li></ul></section>
