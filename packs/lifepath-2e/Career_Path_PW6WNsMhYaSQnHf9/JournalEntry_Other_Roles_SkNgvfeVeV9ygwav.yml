        <p>You specialize in personal security, protecting an individual,
        whether a paying client, or someone you were assigned to. Militaries
        tend not to employ specific bodyguards in this sense, but they may have
        specialists trained in protecting important personnel—ambassadors,
        admirals, political figures, and similar—as needed.</p><p></p><p>ROLE
        BENEFIT: Choose a single character—another player character or an
        NPC—who you are assigned to protect. When you are in the same zone as
        that character, you may spend 1 Momentum (Immediate) when that character
        is attacked to have the Attack target you instead. If you do this, the
        attack’s Difficulty is increased by 1.</p>

        <p>You are an expert in a particular field, working alongside the crew
        to consult upon a matter related to your expertise. You are highly
        specialized and extremely capable in your chosen field, but this may
        lead you to ignore or overlook things that fall outside your knowledge
        or result in an obsession that causes you to prioritize your work over
        other concerns.</p><p></p><p>ROLE BENEFIT: You gain one additional
        value, which must reflect the importance of your work to you. In
        addition, select one of your focuses—this is the field you are an expert
        in. When you use this focus on a task and succeed, you generate 1 bonus
        Momentum (bonus Momentum may not be saved).</p>

        <p>You are not a traditional part of the fleet. Instead, you are an
        operative of the intelligence services of your civilization. You are
        charged with gathering information from places and people that don’t
        want their information gathered, and you achieve this through a
        combination of your own skills and the network of informants and
        contacts you have cultivated.</p><p></p><p>ROLE BENEFIT: Once per
        adventure, you may create a trait without requiring a task or spending
        any Momentum, Threat, or Determination. This trait must reflect
        information, physical resources, or access to a location (such as access
        codes or identification data) provided to you by a contact or by your
        agency.</p>

        <p>You’re a merchant or trader, exchanging valuable goods for latinum or
        other goods. Even in the Federation, merchants are necessary for
        ensuring resources can easily move from place to place. The Federation
        and its members maintain reserves of latinum and other precious
        commodities to allow them to trade with other civilizations. In a
        practical sense, merchants are well-connected and often have access to
        unusual items or specialized resources not usually
        available.</p><p></p><p>ROLE BENEFIT: Once per adventure, you can ignore
        the opportunity costs on up to three items of equipment being acquired
        by other player characters. You may even allow other player characters
        to obtain items not normally available to them (such as disruptors to a
        Starfleet crew, or items which are restricted or illegal), though you
        add 1 Threat for each such item provided.</p>

        <p>You serve as a representative of a government, representing their
        needs and interests during the operations of the crew, and providing the
        crew with a means of communicating with that government in turn. This is
        often the case where multiple groups are required to coexist, such as a
        Starfleet facility operating close to an allied non-Federation world, or
        as part of a joint operation between Starfleet and Klingon Defense Force
        personnel.</p><p></p><p>ROLE BENEFIT: You represent the official
        government your organization belongs to—i.e., if you are a member of the
        Bajoran Militia, you represent the current Bajoran government. You gain
        an additional Directive, which only applies to you, which reflects the
        political stance of the government you represent.</p><p>Your gamemaster
        will work with you to determine the wording of this Directive. It serves
        to provide you with a source of complications and potential restrictions
        when acting against the interests of your government, and benefits when
        you are acting with the full support of your superiors.</p>

        <p>You are an expert in language and communication. While the
        development of the universal translator has reduced the need for
        translators during daily life in the 23rd and 24th centuries, there are
        still situations which call for experts in linguistics. Encounters with
        new cultures often require support from xenolinguistics experts to
        smooth over any problems that the universal translator has, particularly
        if a culture has an unusual style or method of communication. Similarly,
        archaeological research often requires piecing together extinct
        languages from evidence in ways that can’t easily be
        automated.</p><p></p><p>ROLE BENEFIT: When attempting to read,
        understand, or speak a language unfamiliar to you, you may spend 2
        Momentum (Immediate) to piece together a basic understanding of that
        language immediately, enough to convey simple ideas. This allows social
        tasks to be attempted in this language, but the complication range of
        these tasks is increased to 18–20. Deeper study, at the gamemaster’s
        discretion, allows you to remove this penalty and discuss more complex
        ideas.</p>
