        <p>While Starfleet is best known for its highly competent officers, they
        are not the only personnel in Starfleet.</p><p>Each year, a great many
        people enlist in Starfleet rather than joining the Academy. This is
        often the case for those who do not meet the requirements for the
        Academy, or who only wish to serve for a few years to gain some life
        experience.</p><p>Enlisted crew receive basic training in starship
        procedures and protocols, as well as any specific courses required for
        their position, at the Starfleet Technical Services Academy on Mars,
        before being posted to a starship, starbase, or other
        facility.</p><p>The demand for these enlisted crew varies over time,
        with major recruitment drives occurring during times when Starfleet is
        expanding, or needs to replenish losses from disasters or times of
        conflict. Still, it’s a rare ship that has no enlisted personnel,
        typically within the Operations department, and experienced
        non-commissioned officers (NCOs) are highly prized for their practical
        knowledge and hard-won experience. A few NCOs obtain a commission later
        in their careers, becoming full officers.</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLE
        CHARACTERS: Janice Rand (Star Trek), Miles O'Brien (Deep Space
        Nine)</p><p></p><ul><li><p>TRAIT: The character gains the trait
        Starfleet Crew.</p></li><li><p>VALUE: The character gains a single
        value, which should reflect some aspect of the character’s beliefs that

        effort</p></li><li><p>Nowhere else can I get this
        experience</p></li><li><p>Don’t call me sir; I work for a
        living</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ATTRIBUTES: The character gains three
        points, which may be split between two or three attributes (increase
        three attributes by 1 each, or increase one by 2 and another by 1). The
        character may pick these attributes freely.</p></li><li><p>DEPARTMENTS:
        The player must select one of Conn, Security, Engineering, or Science,
        and increase it by 2. Then, choose any two other departments, and
        increase them by 1 each. A character may not have any department higher
        than 4 at this stage.</p></li><li><p>FOCUSES: The character selects
        three focuses, at least one of which should relate to whichever
        department was increased by +2.Examples include:

        Medicine, EVA, Hand Phasers, Hand-to-hand Combat, Helm Operations,
