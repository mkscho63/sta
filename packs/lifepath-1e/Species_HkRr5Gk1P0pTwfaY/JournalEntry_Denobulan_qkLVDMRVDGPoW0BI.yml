        None</p><p>Hailing from the planet Denobula, Denobulans are a
        gregarious, inquisitive people who have been allies of Humanity since
        the 2130s. Though Denobula was not one of the founders of the
        Federation, the Denobulans joined soon after. Denobulans are a sociable
        people, with distinctive expressive features, who are used to living in
        close, communal conditions, and whose extended family groups are large
        and complex — a Denobulan may have several spouses, each of whom may
        have several partners of their own, and dozens of children between them.
        Culturally, they are intellectually curious, perceptive, and interested
        in a wide range of philosophies, though their scholarly nature, large
        families, and gregarious nature means that relatively few of them
        venture far from their homeworld.</p><p><strong>Example Value:</strong>

        Denobulans have a robust immune system, but a vulnerability to various
        forms of radiation poisoning. They are naturally adept climbers,
        scuttling up sheer walls like some forms of terrestrial lizard.
        Denobulans do not need to sleep, but must hibernate for several days
        each year, becoming disoriented if kept awake during this
        period.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talents:</strong> The character receives
