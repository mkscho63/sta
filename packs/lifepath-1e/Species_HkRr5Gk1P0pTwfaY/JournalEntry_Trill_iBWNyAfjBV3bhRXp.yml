        Trill species, from their homeworld of the same name, appear almost
        identical to Humans, but for rows of spots running down the sides of
        their bodies, from head to toe. However, this superficial similarity
        conceals a considerable difference — the Trill are capable of bonding
        with a symbiotic organism known as a symbiont, creating a distinct being
        from the two individual creatures. The symbionts can live for many
        centuries, and are placed with successive hosts, carrying the memories
        and knowledge of previous hosts into a new joining with each new
        generation. This fact isn’t widely known outside the Trill themselves,
        but it isn’t a secret — it simply isn’t widely discussed, and the number
        of joined Trill is relatively small. The Trill have been part of the
        Federation for well over a century, with several renowned Trill serving
        important roles in shaping the Federation. The Trill, as a culture, tend
        to be focused on intellectual pursuits first and foremost, as learning
        and wisdom are prized by the symbionts in their
        hosts.</p><p><strong>Example Value:</strong>

        Trill. Trill are especially resilient to parasites, as a quirk of their
        potential to be Joined; Joined Trill are entirely immune to parasitic
        infection. However, they tend to have strong allergic reactions to
        insect bites and other forms of venom, which can disrupt their
        neurochemistry, particularly if they’re Joined. As many of the specifics
        of Trill physiology — especially with regards to symbiosis — are not
        widely known, this can result in medical
        complications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talents:</strong> The character
