        Bajor, the Bajorans have lost much after decades of occupation by the
        Cardassian Union. Many Bajorans were scattered across the Alpha Quadrant
        during the occupation, while those who remained on Bajor often acted as
        insurgents or toiled in labor camps under Cardassian rule. The
        occupation ended a few years ago, but the scars it left will take
        generations to heal. Bajor is not a member of the Federation, but many
        Bajorans scattered by the diaspora have found their way into Starfleet.
        Bajoran culture places a strong belief in the Prophets, celestial beings
        who are said to have watched over Bajor for millennia; modern religious
        doctrine states that the Bajoran Wormhole is the Prophets’ Celestial
        Temple.</p><p><strong>Example Value:</strong>

        obvious reasons, Bajorans tend to be hostile towards Cardassians, and
        resentful of those who are dismissive of, or turned a blind eye to, the
        suffering of the Bajoran people. While not all Bajorans are spiritual or
        religious to the same degree, most have a cultural understanding of the
        Prophets’ place in Bajoran
        society.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talents:</strong> The character receives
