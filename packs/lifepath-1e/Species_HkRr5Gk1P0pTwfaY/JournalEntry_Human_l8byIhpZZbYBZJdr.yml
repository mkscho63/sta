        None</p><p>Originating on the planet Earth in the Sol system, Humans are
        a resilient, diverse, and adaptable species, who developed from
        fractious, warring nations on the brink of mutual annihilation to a
        united, peaceful society in less than a century, and managed to forge
        alliances between former enemies within a century of achieving
        interstellar space flight. Earth is a founder and pivotal member of the
        United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s institutions
        can be found on Earth. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy in their nature
        — being both driven to strong emotion and careful reason — and while
        they have largely grown beyond their warlike and divisive past, their
        drive and capacity for aggression are as much a part of their success as
        their curiosity and analytical minds.</p><p><strong>Example

        the normal Attribute options, choose three Attributes and add +1 to each
        of them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trait:</strong> Human. Humans are
        adaptable and resilient, and their resolve and ambition often allow them
        to resist great hardship and triumph despite great adversity. However,
        Humans can also be reckless and stubborn, irrational, and
        unpredictable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talents:</strong> The character
