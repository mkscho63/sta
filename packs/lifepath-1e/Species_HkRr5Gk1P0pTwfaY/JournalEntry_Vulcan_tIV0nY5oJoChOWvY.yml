        None</p><p>The Vulcans are a stoic, rational people. Widely claimed to
        be emotionless, in truth the Vulcans feel deeply and intensely, to their
        own detriment. Their stoicism comes from a culture of logic and
        self-discipline, where emotions are analyzed and dissected to rob them
        of their potency, so that they cannot overwhelm or control the
        individual. Vulcans embrace science and reason, but their lives are not
        purely devoted to logic: they also have a deeply philosophical side,
        with art and music as vital to their culture as logic. They are also an
        intensely private people, with many aspects of their culture — such as
        the rites of pon farr — which are not discussed amongst
        outsiders.</p><p><strong>Example Value:</strong>
        @UUID[Compendium.sta-compendia.values-core.QoKhoFmQ7WyNgV4F]{The needs
        of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the
        one}</p><ul><li><p><strong>Attributes:</strong> +1 Control, +1 Fitness,
        +1 Reason</p></li><li><p><strong>Trait:</strong> Vulcan. Due to the
        harsh, arid, high-gravity world they come from, Vulcans are naturally
        resistant to extreme heat and dehydration; they are also extremely
        strong, with keen auditory and olfactory senses. They are also
        telepathic, though this takes training to properly manifest, and they
        learn mental discipline and emotional control from childhood. However,
        this control takes regular meditation to maintain, and their controlled
        nature and desire for privacy can distance them from others, and make
        interactions awkward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talents:</strong> The
