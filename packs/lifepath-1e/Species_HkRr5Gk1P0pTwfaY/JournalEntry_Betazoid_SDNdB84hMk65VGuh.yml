        Generation era only</p><p>The peaceful Betazoid people hail from the
        idyllic, verdant world Betazed. The world is a valued member of the
        Federation, and its people can be found across Federation space,
        including Starfleet. Betazoids appear almost identical to Humans, but
        differ in one major way: they are naturally telepathic, developing
        mental abilities during adolescence. The potency of this ability varies
        between individuals, but it has resulted in a culture where honesty and
        directness are fundamental: it is difficult to keep secrets when
        everyone around you can read minds.</p><p><strong>Example

        Betazoid. All Betazoids are telepathic to varying degrees, and even when
        not actively using their abilities, they are highly perceptive of others
        around them, but also highly sensitive to telepathic disturbances and
        mental assaults. They have little familiarity with lies and deception,
        due to their open culture and ability to read the thoughts and emotions
        of others. As they are sensitive to the minds of other living beings,
        they tend not to be comfortable around animals, for fear of losing
        themselves in the minds of wild
        creatures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talents:</strong> The character
        receives access to the following talents. A Betazoid character must
        select one of the Betazoid talents at some point during character
        creation, to reflect their telepathy. Characters who are only partially
        Betazoid may not select the Telepath
        talent.</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[Compendium.sta-compendia.species-talents-core.5qsqsqexlX3CMaJo]{Empath}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[Compendium.sta-compendia.species-talents-core.Bi3fCsJGbSc1zgJK]{Telepath}</p></li></ul></li></ul>
