        Andoria, the Andorians have been part of the United Federation of
        Planets since its foundation, having been firm allies of Humanity for
        several years beforehand. Their blue skin, pale hair, and antennae give
        them a distinctive appearance, and while the Andorian Imperial Guard was
        demobilized when the Federation was founded, they still maintain strong
        military traditions, and a tradition of ritualized honor-duels known as
        Ushaan, using razorsharp ice-mining tools.</p><p><strong>Example

        Andorian. This trait may reduce the Difficulty of Tasks to resist
        extreme cold, or Tasks impacted by extremely low temperatures. Their
        antennae aid in balance and spatial awareness; a lost antenna can be
        debilitating until it regrows. Andorians also have a high metabolism,
        meaning, amongst other things, that they tire more quickly than Humans;
        this also makes them more vulnerable to infection from certain types of
        injury. Before the Federation, Andorians and Vulcans had numerous
        disputes; though these issues are largely considered to be ancient
        history, Andorians and Vulcans don’t always get
        along.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talents:</strong> The character receives
