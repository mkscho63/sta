  "sta.tooltip.action.melee": "Attempt a Daring + Security task with a Difficulty of 1. If the target is aware of your attack and able to defend themselves, this becomes an opposed task instead, resisted by the target’s own Daring + Security.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.ranged": "Attempt a Control + Security task with a Difficulty of 2. If the target has Cover from the attack (see Cover, page 287), then this becomes an opposed task instead, resisted by the target's own Control + Security.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.firstaid": "The First Aid action allows you to attempt a Daring + Medicine task with a Difficulty of 2 to tend to another character within Reach. If you complete the task, the patient is no longer Defeated. Alternatively, you may attempt a Daring + Medicine task with a Difficulty equal to the Injury’s severity to treat an Injury the patient has suffered. A treated Injury no longer imposes any penalty, but it is still an Injury, and it will need proper medical treatment to remove entirely. Longer-term healing cannot be done during combat. An Injured character requires medical treatment to remove the Injury completely. This treatment is normally a Control + Medicine task with a Difficulty of X and takes X hours, where X is the severity in both cases. Add 1 to the Difficulty and the complication range if the Injury was not treated. If the patient has multiple Injuries, treating them all at once could be treated as a challenge, or even as an extended task (with a progress track of 3x the number of Injuries), at the gamemaster’s discretion.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.direct": "Spend 1 Momentum and select one ally on the bridge who immediately attempts a single major action, and you assist them by rolling 1d20 with your Control + Command.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.guard": "You defend yourself, preparing for an attack. This is an Insight + Security task with a Difficulty of 0. Success increases the Difficulty of any attacks against you by 1 until the start of your next turn. You can confer the benefits of this task to an ally within Reach instead of yourself—this increases the Difficulty of this task by 1, and the benefit lasts until the start of your ally’s next turn.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.sprint": "You run forward, trying to cross the area quickly. You move two zones, to any point within Long range. If there is difficult or hazardous terrain, you may attempt a Fitness + Conn task with Difficulty 0 as part of this action, to generate Momentum to cross the terrain as part of this action.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.rally": "You inspire and coordinate the crew, attempting a Presence + Command task with a Difficulty of 0; this task is specifically to generate Momentum, either to use immediately or to save for the group.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.damagecontrol": "Choose a single breach and attempt a Presence + Engineering task, with a Difficulty of 2; increase this by 1 per additional degree of Potency. If successful, the breach is patched, and no longer imposes penalties or effects. The breach will require proper repairs outside of combat.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.regainpower": "You draw energy from another system to replenish the ship’s Reserve Power. Attempt a Control + Engineering task, with a Difficulty of 1. This may Succeed at Cost. On success, you restore the ship’s Reserve Power, allowing it to be used later during the scene. Complications should reflect subsystems shutdown to use their power. The Difficulty for this task increases by 1 each time it is attempted during a scene.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.attack": "Attempt a Control + Security task, assisted by the ship’s Weapons + Security, with a Difficulty determined by the Attack action chosen. For an energy weapon, the Difficulty is 2. For torpedoes, the Difficulty is 3.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.transport": "A transporter has an effective range of several thousand kilometers, and a standard transporter room can transport up to six people at once. Transporting from a transporter pad to a destination transporter pad is a Control + Engineering task with a Difficulty of 0, assisted by the ship’s Sensors + Science. Transporting from a transporter pad to another site (one without a transporter pad), or vice versa, increases the Difficulty by 1, while a site-to-site transport increases the Difficulty by 2.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.attackpattern": "You fly steadily to make it easier for your shipmates to target the enemy. If you take this action, each time your ship makes an attack before your next turn, you may Assist on that attack, using your Control + Conn. However, until your next turn, all attacks against the ship reduce their Difficulty by 1.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.evasiveaction": "You maneuver the ship in a quick, unpredictable way to foil enemy targeting. If you take this action, then until your next turn, all attacks against your ship become opposed tasks, opposed using your Daring + Conn and assisted by the ship’s Structure + Conn. If you win the opposed task, you may move the ship 1 zone. However, until the start of your next turn, all attacks made by your ship suffer +1 Difficulty. You cannot take this action if the ship is currently benefiting from the Defensive Fire action (page 305).",
  "sta.tooltip.action.maneuver": "You focus on carefully controlling the ship’s flight. Attempt a Control + Conn task with Difficulty 0, assisted by the ship’s Engines + Conn. This is normally used to generate Momentum for crossing difficult terrain.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.ram": "You choose a single enemy vessel or other target within Close range and move into Contact with them. This is an Attack, requiring a Daring + Conn task with a Difficulty of 2, assisted by the ship’s Engines + Conn. If successful, the Attack inflicts the ship’s collision damage (see sidebar) on the target, with the Intense quality, but suffers the target’s collision damage in return.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.warp": "Requires Reserve Power. You must take a Prepare minor action to take this action. Attempt a Control + Conn task with a Difficulty of 1, assisted by the ship’s Engines + Conn. If you succeed, you move the ship a number of zones equal to the ship’s Engines score, or you leave the battlefield entirely. See Going to Warp, page 295.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.regenerateshields": "Requires Reserve Power. You reroute Reserve Power to the shield emitters, attempting to restore their strength. This requires a Control + Engineering task with a Difficulty of 2, assisted by the ship’s Structure + Engineering; the Difficulty increases by 1 if the ship’s shields are at 0. If successful, the ship regains shields equal to your Engineering department, plus 2 more by spending 1 Momentum (Repeatable).",
  "sta.tooltip.action.reveal": "You scan for the trace signals that may reveal the tell-tale presence of a cloaked vessel, or a vessel concealed by some other phenomenon. Attempt a Reason + Science task, assisted by the ship’s Sensors + Science, with a Difficulty of 3. If you succeed, and there is a hidden vessel within Long range, you reveal which zone it is in (if there are multiple, this only reveals one such vessel, chosen at random). Until that vessel moves, your ship may attack that hidden vessel, but increasing the Difficulty by 2.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.scanforweakness": "You scan an enemy vessel, looking for vulnerabilities. Choose a single vessel and attempt a Control + Science task with a Difficulty of 2, assisted by the ship’s Sensors + Security. If this succeeds, the next attack made against that ship increases its damage by 2, or gains the Piercing quality.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.sensorsweep": "You use the sensors to scan for information. Select a single zone to scan, and attempt a Reason + Science task, assisted by the ship’s Sensors + Science, with a Difficulty of 1. If successful, the gamemaster provides basic information on any ships, objects, or other phenomena in that zone; you may spend Momentum to get extra information as normal.",
  "sta.tooltip.action.defensivefire": "Choose a single energy weapon on your ship. Until your next turn, any enemy attack against your ship becomes an opposed task, opposed by your Daring + Security (and assisted by your ship’s Weapons + Security) at the same Difficulty. If you succeed, you may spend 2 Momentum to counterattack, inflicting your weapon’s damage against the attacker. You cannot take this action if the ship is currently benefitting from Evasive Action (page 302).",
  "sta.tooltip.action.tractorbeam": "The character engages a tractor beam at a nearby object or vessel. This requires a Control + Security task, assisted by the ship’s Structure + Security with a Difficulty of 2, and can only be directed at a target within Close range. If successful, the target vessel is immobilized and cannot move unless it can break free. This can be done in a number of ways, but the Difficulty is equal to the tractor beam strength of your vessel."
